secretis: abl. of place, ‘in Pammenes* private receptacles:

Ostorii Scapulae ε see xiv 48.

inminere rehum ‘ were menacing the empire.’

ξ 5. liburnioae=biremes.

obsignaret: seven Roman citizens were required as witnesses to
the signature of a will ; all seared to stand as witnesses to Anteius’
will, not daring to acknowledge themselves as his friends. (Subj.
aster ‘ut,' but imperf. like ‘ibatur‚’ xiii 2, 1, of an incomplete
tendency: Intr. 11 38.)

nisi, &c., ‘had not Tigellinus authorized them to do so, from
having first recommended Anteius not to delay in making his last
dispositions.’

ξ 6. hausto veneno: Intr. 11 21 e.

CH. 15,§ 1. apud finem, ‘on the boundary of'3 cf. ‘ad finem

ξ 4. haetenus, ‘only to this extent,' cf. xiv 3, 2.

iugulo τ ablative, ‘ he met (the point) with his throat.'

CH. 16. The general argument of this chapter is as follows:
‘This catalogue of tyrannical executions grows tedious, and the
Iack of spirit shown by the victims might incline the historian to
pass contemptuously over any record of their death. Ι do not
however avoid such record : these horrors were due to the wrath of
Heaven, and the victims deserve pity not condemnation. The
historian must record evil as well as good; here I have to describe
not a single calamity suffered by the whole body of the state and
capable of narration in a single passage, but one that was distributed
over a multitude of persons who, owing to their distinguished
position, require individual mention.'

§ 1. tanta casuum similitudine, ‘ all attended by such uniformity
of painful detail.’

meque : the apodosis begins here, and ‘meque ’ is answered by
‘aliorumque’ “

aspernantium, ‘disliking’ (cf. xiv 42, 2). quamviS‚ &c.‚ ¹ who,
however noble those deaths might be, would dislike the unencling
tale of misery.’

ξ 2. nune, ‘as the case is.’

maestitia restringunt, ⁴ oppress,’ ‘paralyse ⁷ the mind with grief.
Perhaps, however, ‘maestitiam' should be read3 then ‘restrin-
gunt’ =‘bind fast‚' ‘suppress.' Madv. suggests ‘restinguunt’ =
‘quench,’ which, if we may adopt ‘maestitiam,’ gives much the
same meaning. ⁷

neque, δια, ‘ and 1 shall not demand from my readers any further
excuse, except that 1 need not show hate for those who died so
tarnely ’ (by omitting to record their deaths).

ξ 3. ira illa, &et cf. ‘fatali omnium ignavia‚' xv 61, 6.
