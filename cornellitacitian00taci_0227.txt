BOOK XIV. CH. 21, ξ 8 — CH. 25, ἐξ 1—2

from xiii 41, and appears to deal with the two years 59 and 60 A. D.
See Intr. V 3 and 4.

recenti terrore : the terror caused by the destruction of
Artaxata would be recent even if we suppose he had wintered there
after its surrender.

intenderet, ‘ intensify.’

infenso, ‘in hostile fashion.’

remissa eura, ‘ relaxing precautions.’

gnarus, &c., ‘well aware that this people, so ready to change,
could be treacherous when opportunity offered, just as it shrank
back in the face of danger!

§3. diversis artibus: a curious application of the ablat. of
description, ‘misericordia' and ‘celeritate ’ standing in apposition
to ‘artibus’ Cf. Intr. 11 22 (a). ‘Employing opposite methods‚
leniency towards the suppliant but summary measures against the
fugitives?

ς’ 4. praegredientem = ‘praetergredientem.’

Mardi: a race living on Mount Niphates, ancestors of the
modem Kurds. The name is preserved in ‘ Mardistan.'

Hiberis : the Hiberi were voluntary allies of Corbulo from hatred
of the Armenians. Cf. xiii 37, 3.

vastavit: Tacitus uses ‘ vastare aliquem ’ -- ‘vastare alicuius
terram.² Cf. ch. 38, 2, and xv 1, 2.

externo sanguine: without sacrifice of Roman lives.

CH. 24, ξ 1. fatiscebant, ‘were becoming exhausted.'

earne pecudum : to a Roman soldier corn meal was the great
necessity of life, and the substitution of animal sood for it was
prejudicial. So Caesar (B. G. vii 17, 3) speaks of meat as famine
diet, ⁴ ut complures dies milites frumento caruerint, et pecore. . . ex-
tremam samem sustentarent.' For ‘ adigere' with infin. cf. Intr. II 31.

ξ 2. ad hoc: πρὸς wiron, ‘besideS.’

ξ 4. Tauraunitium: genit. plur. rather than acc. sing. The

Taurus range: it was probably the district of Mush, west of Lake
Van.

ξ 6. Tigranocerta: see Intr. 11 62.

might maintain a more willing obedience.’

CH. ¹25,§ 1. Legerda: corrected from Med. ‘legerat,’ owing to
the mention by Ptolemy (v 13, 20} of Αέγερδα as a place between
the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates, and thus west or north-
west of Tigranocerta.

pro muris, ‘ outside the walls!

aggeri : a mound constructecl against the walls to make it possible
for the besiegers to climb over, such as that described in Thuc. (ii
75) at the siege of Plataea.
