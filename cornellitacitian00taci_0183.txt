tioned in lnscrr. as early as in the time of Augustus, and under
Claudius the ‘praegustatores’ formed a ‘ collegium ' under a ‘ pro-
cu1·at0r.’ Similar precautions were taken by the Medo-Persian
despots; and so also Athenaeus, writing of Hiero's court, mentions
‘ προγευσταί’ who ‘ προήσθιον τῶν βασιλέων πρὸς· (ὶσφιὶλειιιν’ (Ath. 4. 71,
1716). ,

§ 3. fervore: abl. of cause. See Intr. 11 19.

ξ 4. inprudentes, ‘those not in the secret.'

resistunt, ‘kept their seats!

ξ 5. reclinis : a word not found in prose before Tacitus.

neseio similis, ‘as if unconscious.' Cf. ‘ignaro propior' (Arm.
xi 1).

an adjournment.

ξ 6. emicuit, ‘ betrayed itself‚’ in a sudden expression of face.

CH. 17, ξ 1. nox eadem: sor such personifications see Intr.
11 53. Dio and Suetonius describe the funeral as performed not
at night but on the following day. But the language of the edict
(ξ 4) supports Tacitus' account.

ξ 2. in campo Martis: where Augustus’ mausoleum stood.

sepultus: refers to the deposition of his ashes.

etiam: the idea is that human judgment is unlikely to be more
lenient than the divine, yet even among men excuse was found for
the crime; hence the ‘vulgus’ were probably wrong in ascribing
the storrn to divine displeasure. The lax moral judginent involved
in this reasoning is due to the prevalence of such crimes in ancient
despotisms.

antiquas: e. g. Atreus and Thyestes, Eteocles and Polynices,
Romulus and Remus. Cf. ‘solita fratribus odia' (Arm. iv 60, 5).

aestimantes, ‘taking into account.‘

ξ 3. saera- mensae: referring primarily to the customary libations
to the Lares and Penatesi The religious sanction thus appertain-
ing to the meal further involves the mutual inviolability of those
partaking of it.

and Antonia his half-sister, daughter of Claudius by his second
wife Paetina.

ξ 4. defendit, ‘justified’ The edict was probably composed by
Seneca.

subtrahere oeulis: the ancient Roman custom by which all
funerals were conducted at night survived in the case of those
whose friends could not afford expensive ceremoffles, and of those
who died at an immature age.
