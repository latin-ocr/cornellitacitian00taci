TACITUS ANNALS : NOTES

ᾖ 2. reeens, &c.: the sense is ‘ sed hoc, quod (filia) . . . dilargita
esset, erat crimen recens et quo (accusator) . . . conectebat.'

magis: the term ‘magi,’ sometimes confused with ‘Chaldaei'
(=astrologers), properly denotes dealers in philtreS, spells‚ and in-
cantations. Servilia would be accused not only of trying to divine
the future, but also of secking to bind the emperor by spells.

ξ 3. acciderat: 50 ‘id.’

non tamen aliud consultaverat: a shoit way os expressing

‘consultaverat non tamen aliud quaesiverat (cf. xv 13, 2).

cognitio: cs. 11 1.

nihil atrox,‘ no extreme penalty.’

ξ 4. diversi, ‘ separated {rom each othe1·.’

tribunal consulum ε the expression strictly applies to the con-
sular seat of judgement in the comitium, but is used here, though
the trial was in the senate, because the consuls would be presiding.

in exilium pulso: cf. xv 71, 6.

onerasse, ‘to have aggravated) videbatur: sc. ‘sibi.'

CH. 31, ξ 1. cultus dotales, ‘the ornaments given at her mar-
riage!

longo fletu et silentio: cf. xv 54, 1 ‘multo sermone.’

altaria et aram: a statue and altar of Victory stood in the
Curia Julia. ‘Altaria,' when distinguished from ‘ara,’ sometimes
means a superstructure placed upon the permanent ‘ara’ to
receive burnt or other offerings‚ and so may also indicate the
ofserings themselves, as in Quint. (Decl. 12, 25) ‘aris imponere
altaria,’ and Luc. iii 404 ‘ structae diris altaribus arae ’; sometimes,
on the other hand, ‘altaria’ is explained as a grander kind of altar
than ‘ara,’ and in a fragment of Pacuvius, ‘exanimis altaribus‚'
the sense has been given, agreeing with the derivation from ‘ altus,'
osa raised threshold or step. The alternative renderings therefore
will be (1) ‘the altar with its offerings,' or, (2) ‘the altar-steps and
the altar)

nullos . . . invocavi, ‘1 have appealed to no powers of evil,
have laid no curse on any one, and have sought nothing else in my
wretched pmyers, ' &c. ‘Invocavi ’ has a different sense with

“nullos 1mpios deos' and with‘ aliudss and from it must be supplied
an appropriate verb such as imprecata sum with‘ nullas devo-
tiones? (For other instances of zeugma, see Intr. II 60)

tu, Caesar: this direct address to the‘ princeps' does not

necessarily mean that he was present. Cf. ch. 22, 2.
2. quo modo: sc. ‘ dedissem?

, 3. viderint, isti, ‘let them (i. e. the ‘magi ’) see to it‚’ i.e. it is
their concern if the rites were unholy3 I only paid them to tell me
the future.

CH. 32, ξ 1. excipit, ‘ interrupts!

separarent, ‘let them distinguish between the case of one who

was ‚0¹¹ her trial only sor too great devotion to him and his own
case.

ξ 2. ruebat, nisi: cf. xiii 2, 1; Intr. 11 38.
