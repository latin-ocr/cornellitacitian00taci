TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 5. ‘paterna pecunia,’ ‘ avitum mancipium ’x ironical refer-
ences to the supposed reasons for the crime. By strict law a slave
had no rights to inherit or hold property or to enter into contracts
(‘ transigere ’)‚ so that ⁶ iniuria’ was an absurd term to apply in the
case osa slave.

ultro, ‘let us go further and say!

CH. 44‚§ Ι. libet, Sco, ‘do you wish to hunt up arguments in
a matter already decided by wiser heads ? ’

animum sumpsisse, ‘formed a resolution.’

ut: non, δια, ‘ without letting fall some threatening expression!

d ξ 2. sane: concessive, ‘even grant that he concealed his
esign!

excubias : the slaves guarding the bedroom.

ξ 3. multa, &c.‚ ‘many premonitory signs precede a crime!

servi si prodant, διο, ‘if our slaves betray their fellows’ plots,
we can live, single amid a crowd, safe among the anxious, and
finally, if we have to perish, not unavenged among the guilty) The
argument is ‘ If the old law remains in force it will prompt slaves
to give information of any plot against their master, and we shall
be safe,’ but the actual words do not express this clearly, and, if
the text is sound, the language has sacrificed sense to brevity.
An emendation suggested, ‘servis si pereundum sit ni prodant,’
removes the difficulty, but is somewhat violent.

anxios: careful that no unrevealed plot against their master
should involve them in wholesale destruction.

ξ 4. etiam cum, &c : in old households most or all of the slaves
were born in the house (‘vernae ³).

statim, ἃς. ., ‘and conceived an affection for their masters from
their earliest years’

ξ 5. postquam, Stes, now that we have different nationalities in
our households, possessing religions other than our,s some barbarian
forms of worship or none at all.

ξ 6. at = ‘at enim.'

nam et, ‘yes, for even.

eum decumus quisque, &.c, ‘ decimatio’ as a military punish-
ment is mentioned in Livy as early as 469 Β. C. (Livy ii 59, 4).
Tacitus mentions the ‘decimation' of a cohort for cowardice in
Africa in 20 A. D; Amt. iii 21 ‘decumum quemque ignominiosae
cohortis sorte ductos susti necat.⁹

sortiuntur, ‘draw the lot' for punishment.

§7. omne magnum exemplum,‘ every exemplary punishment
on a large scale involves a certain amount 0f1nJust1ce‚ which is com-
pensated by the public advantage as set against (the wrong done
to) individuals.' For‘ exemplum’ see xv 20, 2; contrast xiii 44, 8.

CH. 45, ξ 1. nemo unus, ‘no one in particular,' i. e. coming
forw ard individually.

aetatem: in later times young boys and girls were exempted
sioni this general execution.

ξ 2 obtemperari, &c., ‘the sentence could not be carried out.’
