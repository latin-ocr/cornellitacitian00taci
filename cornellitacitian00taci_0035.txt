his pleasure, usually sor from three to five years, but often sor much
longer periods ¹, and, like proconsuls of senatorial provinces, had
the assistance of ‘legati,’ as also of a ‘procurator fisci,’ whose
duties answered to those of the quaestor. Η olding osten the com-
mand of large armies, and having much suller power of life and
death ², these governors were in a sar higher real position than that
of a senatorial proconsu13 although, in recognition of the sole
‘proconsulare imperium’ of the emperor, none had a higher title
than that of ⁵ legatus Augusti propraetore.’ Δ

among these are Upper and Lower Germany and Syria, each with
its garrison of four legions, those of the German armies full,7
organized and trained by war against the unsubdued tribes beyond
the Rhine, and those of Syria charged with maintaining the prestige
of Rome against Parthia.

ξ 16. Another class, corresponding to the second class of
senatorial provinces, comprised those in which only a single legion,
or even a smaller force, was stationed. In these the legatus was
usually only of praetorian rank, but had otherwise the same status
as in the greater provinces. As an example os such may be taken
the three divisions of Gaul, Gallia Belgica, Lugdunensis, and
Aquitania, for all of which insignificant forces seem ordinarily to
have sufficed, with the German legions in reserve in case of a rising.

ξ 17. In a third class of provinces of still less importance, the
procurator, of only equestrian rank, instead of being placed under
a legatus, is himself the acting governor, perhaps usually in some
subordination to the legatus osa neighbouring province. One well-
¹ known instance of such a government in the time of Tiberius, that

Corbulo's appointment in the East.

² Senatorial proconsuls could not (except in Afrit a] exceute a soldier; and
any citizen, under a capital charge, could appeal from any governor to
Caesar. A well-known instance is that os St. Paul (Acts xxv. 11).

³ Besides those here mentioned, Hispania Tarraconensis, Moesia,
Pannonia, and Dalmatia, belonged to this class.
