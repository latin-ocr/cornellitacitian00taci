IV
LIFE OF NERO

ξ 1. He was born in December, 37 A.D. About two years later his
father, Cn. Domitius, died, and his mother Agrippina, daughter of
Germanicus, the favourite hero of both army and people, was
banished on the discove1y of Lentulus Gaetulicus’ plot against
Gaius. She was however recalled by Claudius shortly after his
accession, January 41, A.D.‚ her son having meanwhile been under
the charge of his aunt Domitia Lepida. In his early childhood he
was exposed to the jealous dislike of Messalina, but, owing doubt-
less to his descent from Germanicus, he was a favourite of the
pcople‚ and in 47 Α. D., at his appearance in the ‘ludus Troiae’ in
the ‘ ludi saeculares’ together with Messalina’s son Britannicus, he
obtained a noticeable preponderance of applause.

ξ 2. On Messalina's overthrow, 48 A.D.‚ Agrippina became wife
of Claudius, and did not rest till she had secured her own son's
preference over the head of Britannicus. In 49 A.D., he was
betrothed to Octavia, daughter of Claudius, and in the next year
was adopted by the emperor, a step recommended as likely to
strengthen Britannicus' position! He now laid aside the name of
L. Domitius and took that of Ti. Claudius Nero Caesar, or, more
sully, Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus, and was soon
enabled to supplant the ‘brother' whom he was supposed to
support. Being three years older than Britannicus, he now took
precedence as Claudius’ eldest son; in 51 A.D. he assumed the
toga virilis before the rightful age, received the title of princeps
iuventutis, held proconsulare imperium except within the city, and
was designated to hold the consulship in his twentieth year. These
honours, and his appearance in the circus in the state dress of
a Roman magistrate where Britannicus was simultaneously seen
in mere boy’s ‘praetexta' sufficiently indicated which of the two
was designed to be Claudius' successor. The powerful freedman
Narcissus attempted to secure a reaction against Agrippina's in-
fluence and to ensure the succession sor Britannicus, but Agrippina
removed the emperor by poison lest his vacillation might undo her
schemes ; the praetorians were commanded by her nominee Burrus,
