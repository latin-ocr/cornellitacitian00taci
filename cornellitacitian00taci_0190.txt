TACITUS ANNALS ε NOTES

ξ 3. concessum: probably by an edict of Augustus, who is
known to have regulated the rights of patrons and others towards
freedinen. This power of ‘relegatio’ without the intervention of
a magistrate was a survival of the ancient ‘ patria potestas' held
by the head of a family.

ut centesimum ε [Med. gives ‘vicesimuin‚' without ‘ ut.’]
One hundred miles is known to have been in later times the limit
of the jurisdiction of the ⁴ praefectus urbi,' and as a lirnit of banish-
ment was of older and perhaps even Republican date. ‘ To banish
beyond the hundredth milestone—to the coast of Campania !’ (one
of the most delightful parts of Italy, where the fashionable holiday
resorts were situated).

ceteras, &oz i. e. except for this power of ‘relegatio,’ which
was no punishment at all, the patron only had the ordinary legal
procedure available, in which they stood on equal ternis.

ξ 4. nee grave, &c.‚ ‘it was no oppressive burden sor the dis—
charged to preserve their sreedom by the same obedience as that
by which they had earned it!

retinendi: genitive depending on the idea of a substantive im-
plied, such as ‘ onus,’ (from ‘grave ⁷). So Ann. xv 5, 3, ‘Vologesi
vetus et penitus infixum erat arma Romana vitandi,' where a subst.,
‘ habit,’ is implied from ‘ vetus et penitus infixum ’ ; (Intr. 11 26).

CH. 27, ξ 1. id corpus: i. e. the mass of freedmen.

§2 hine, ‘it was from these to a great extent that the tribes
were drawn.’ The four urban tribes are probably meant.

decurias : associations of public servants, such as lictors,
flerks (‘ scribae ')‚ auctioneers (‘ praecones ')‚ servers os summonses
‘ viatores ’).

ministeria: abstr. for concrete, ‘attendants' other than those
enrolled in {he ‘ decuriae,' such as court ushers (‘ accensi') and criers
(‘calatores’ .

cohortes: the ‘vigiles,’ a police force consisting of seven co-
horts‚ each 1,000 strong, half a cohort being allotted to each os the
fourteen ‘ regiones ³ into which Rome was divided.

plurimis, &c.‚ ‘most of the knights, very many of the senators,
derive their origin from no higher source! Under Tiberius the full
privileges os Roman knighthood had been restricted to ‘ingenui’
of three generations; but the rule must have always had excep-
tions, and was now much relaxed.

libertini: adjectival form, denoting freedmen as a class. ‘If
freedrnen were made a distinct class‚the scarcity of free-born citizens
would be too noticeable.’

ξ 3. oum dignitatem, &c.‚ ‘while they admitted distinctions in
the honours accorded to different ranks, they made freedom the
common possession of all)

§4 manu mittendi, &oz the distinction is between full and
partial manumission. The former (‘ iusta manumissio') was effected
by a ceremony in presence os a consul or praetor (or proconsul or
propraetor), when the slave was touched by the lictor's wand
