BOOK xv. CH. 44, ᾗ 5 —crr 47, ἕξ 1-3

Secundo Carrinate: probably son of the rhetor-ician of that
name who was exiled by Gaius (Juv. vii 207).

§4 ore tenus (cf. ch. 6, 6 ‘nomine tenus'), ‘an adept in the
verbal profession of Greek philosophy.’

ξ 5. oravisse: this passage implies that his former request for
retirement from the court had not been granted (xiv 52756) and
that he was still one of Nero‘s ⁴ concilium.'

aeger nervis, ‘having a muscular complaint' (rheumatism or
gout). (egressust the use of the accus. governed transitively by
this verb originates with Caesar and Livy.)

ξ 6. dum . . . tolerat: see Intr 11 37.

persimplici: ἅπ. εἰρ. Intr. 11 51, c.

agrestibus pomis, ‘ fruit growing wild,' as distinct from highly
cultivated garden produce: so Germ. 23, 1 ‘ cibi simplices, agrestia
poma.’

profluente, ‘from a running stream.’

CH. 46, ᾗ 1. gladiatores: evidently kept at Praeneste in a
training-school. Praeneste = Palaesfflna, about twenty-three

adesset: so Med„ but the subjunctive is inexplicable without
supplying some such participle as ‘ibi locato ⁹ or ‘existente’ to
‘ praesidio,’ ‘ a military force being stationed there to be a guard on
the spot.’ Such an ellipse would be exceedingly harsh. An
inferior MS. reads ‘aderat,’ and ‘adest’ has been suggested for
‘adesset’

outbreak of only seventy- -four gladiators troni the school of Capua.

CH. 47, ᾗ I. vis: so in ch. 5, 4, &c

semper expiatum: a rhetorical exaggeration (like ‘saepe’ in
xiii 6, 1), only one othei· comet having been mentioned by Tacitus
before this, viz. that of xiv 22, 1. sanguine inlustri applies in
this case to the executions following the detection of the conspiracy
of Piso, and in the case of the previous comet to the exile and
death of Rubellius Plautus and Cornelius Sulla.

ᾗ 2. abiecti in publicum, ‘were publicly exposed!

gravidas hostias: such sacrifices were called ‘hordicidia ’
(‘horda '=‘praegnans vacca '), and are mentioned in Ovid as paid
to Tellus and to Faunus.
