Vettio Bolano: he was consul suffectus with C. Calpurnius
Piso, and in 69 A. D. became legatus of Britain. He seems also to

mantled by Lucullus, but had been subsequently refortified.

ξ 3. Nicephorius : if Pliny’s mention of this river, in the JV. H„ as
a tributary of the Tigris is to be accepted, it might be the ‘ssitlis-Suf
But the identification of Tigranocerta with ‘Tell-Ermen ’ har-
monizes best with the accounts of the place given in Tacitus and
Strabo, in which case this river must be taken to be a branch of the
