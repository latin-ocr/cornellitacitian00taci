ξ 2. equitum, &c. : the lex Roscia, 67 B. C., which reserved for
the ‘equites' the ‘quattuordecim ordines' next above the orchestra
(where the senators sat), only applied to the theatre. It appears
that special seats in the Circus were reserved sor the senate
under Claudius, and since 4 Α. D. equites had also had better seats
than the populace as a matter of custom; the arrangement was
now made law for the first time.

recorded the appearance of knights in the arena, and of women
and members of the great senatorial samilies on the pantomimic
stage, xiv, chs. 14 and 153 but this passage gives support to
the statements of Dio and Suetonius, who mention senators,
knights, and women appearing in the amphitheatre as early as
59 A. D.
