another army as large as itselt.y Translate, ‘ 1f individual privates
received from the emperor's hand the distinction of a crown sor
saving a fellow-citizen’s life, how great must that glory be when
equal hosts were seen bringing and receiving safety.’

praecipua : i. e. a gist of special distinction. The honours going
with a ‘civic crown’ are given by the elder Pliny: ‘accepta licet

Samnites on the Romans at the ‘Caudine Forks,’ 321 B.C., cf.
Livy ix 1—6. By the ‘Numantine disaster' the capitulation of

Romans, as well as the Samnites, were a mere ‘Italicus populus‚’
