65 [93]. Tacitus further takes evident pains to vary the expression
of facts that have to be stated often ; the great number of different
phrases used by him for such events as death, suicide, banishment
will be readily noticed on reading the text.

66 [95]. The Graecisms in Tacitus are chiefly such as had
already become naturalizcd in Latin. and most have been noticed
in previous paragraphs. To these may be added ut quisque
audentiae habuisset, xv 53, 3 ; ut coniectare erat, xvi 34, 2.

67 [96]. Archaic words revived by Tacitus are mercimonium,
xv 38, 2 (Plautus), and perduellis, xiv 29, 2 (Ennius, Plautus, &c.).

68 [97]. The debt of Tacitus to his chief predecessors in historica]
writing and to the great Classical poets may here be illustrated by
a few instances : others can be gathered from previous sections, cf.
ξ 51 (d) 3 and many others are pointed out in the notes on the text.
