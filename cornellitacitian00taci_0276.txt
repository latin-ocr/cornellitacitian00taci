TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

the palace left space sor,’ an ironical reference to the huge size of
the ‘domus aurea ’ described in the last ch„ in the same vein as
a contemporary epigram quoted by Suetonius, ⁴ Roma domus fiet;
Veios migrate, Quirites, Ι si non et Veios occupet illa domus‚’ and
M artial’s ‘ Unaque iam tota stabat in urbe d01nus.’

dimensis, &c.‚ ‘ with rows of streets regularly measured out.’

cohibita: the limit fixed is not known. The height of buildings
in Rome generally seems nevertheless to have still been regarded
as excessive; cf. Juv. iii 269. Under Trajan a limit of sixty feet
was fixcd. (Such regulations would presumably apply only to
new buildings.)

areis: court-yards inside the ‘insulae‚’ which would help to
prevent the spread of fire from one portion to another.

§2. purgatas areas, ‘the building-sites, cleared of rubbish.’
(‘ Sua pecunia ' applies to ‘purgatas ’ as well as to ‘exstructuru1n.')
With ‘exstructurum’ and ‘traditurum,’ ‘se’ is to be understood.

ξ 3. intra quod: to be taken with the ablative absolute ef-
fectis; ‘a time within which they must finish the mansions or
blocks of buildings to claim the grant! ‘Cfi ‘unde hausta,’ &c.,
ch. 44 1.

ξ 4., ruderi ε liere=‘ rubbish‚’ ‘ debris)

aedificiaque, ἃς, ‘and that the buildings themselves should in
certain specified parts ' (probably the soundations and supports to
the disserent floors), ‘avoiding timber, be strongly constructed out
of Gabine or Alban stone.'

aqua: that flowing into Rome by the aqueducts.

custodes, ‘keepers‚' ‘conservators.' The force of ‘destinabat ’
extending over the whole passage, ‘custodes ' may be (Ι) direct
object, co-ordinated with the subjunctive clause ‘et . . . haberet,'
as ‘paludes’ above is co-ordinated with the subjunctive clause
immediately following it (cf. lntr. II 64 g); or (2) nominative,
‘ essent’ having been lost from the Ms. in copying or boldly
omitted by Tacitus himself.

communione parietum: abstract for concrete=‘ communibus
parietibus' (cf. ‘libidines principis’ = ‘principem libidinosum‚’
xiii 22, 3 and Intr. ΙΙ 57).

quaeque : sc, ‘ aedificia.’ Common walls had always been for-
bidden ; the Twelve Tables enjoined a space of 2¹3 feet round each
⁴ domus’ or ‘ insula' (ambitus parietum sestertius pes esto ’).

ᾗ 5. ex utilitate accepta, ‘approved of as practically ad-
vantageous.'

vapore, ‘ heat.’ Cf. xiv 64, 3.

CH. 44, ξ 1. dis, ‘for the gods,’ i. e. to win their favour3 cf.
⁴ deum placamentis ’ below.

Sibullae libri: kept in the temple of Apollo on the Palatine.

Volcano, &ot he was naturally propitiated as being the fire-
god. The temple of Ceres and Proserpina was near the spot where
the fire had broken out, but the supplication to them may well have
tested on some more general reason, as at other times the Sibylline
