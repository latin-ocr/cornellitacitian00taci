phrase as ‘eodem morbo correpti moriebantur et,’ required by the
sense before ‘ eodem rogo cremabantur.'

ᾗ 4. dilectus: enrolment by conscription of Roman citizens in
the provinces named. Ordinarily the legions were recruited by
voluntary enlistment.

Illyricis: the term covers the legions in Pannonia and Delmatia
(perhaps also those in Moesia).

ξ 5. cladem . . . casibus: according to Seneca (Ep.91, 14l Lug-
dunum was burnt down in the hundredth year from its foundation
as a colony by Plancus in 43 B.C. This would bring the date of the
fire to 58 A.D.‚ which gives rise to the following difficulties 2—(1) the
‘consolation' sent to Lugdunum by Nero is offered some seven
years after the disaster; (2) it is unlikely that the inhabitants could
have sent so large a sum as four million sesterces to Rome after the
Great Fire of 64 Α. D. (indicated by ‘urbis casibus ³) so soon after
their own heavy losses; and (3) ‘ante’ most naturally means
‘before they suffered their own disaster.’ It is probable, there-
fore, that the date given by Seneca for the burning of Lugdunum is
erroneous, and that it should be ascribed to some time after the
tire at Rome. The alternative is to take ‘cladem Lugdunensem'
as a second disaster otherwise unknown3 but it is unlikely that if
such a thing had happened twice within ten years Tacitus would
not have said more about it.

amissa urbi, ‘what their city (i. e. Lugdunum) had lost!
