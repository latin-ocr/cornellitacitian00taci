TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

pl etium frumenti: the price here quoted (= about ed. ), which
evidently was much below the average, was the regular price of
the‘ modius’ (about a peck) ln the time of Cicero. Pliny( (JV. Η.)
gives sorty asses as the average price of a ‘modius' os flour or
111031 (equiv alent to two ‘modii’ of corn), though not of the finest
quality.

CH. 40, §L sexto: a votive inscription has the words‘ urbs
per noveni dies arsit,' from which it may be taken that the second
outbreak of§ 2 lasted three days.

ut, &c.‚ ‘so that to its continued raging there might be opposed
a level space and, so to speak, open sky,' there being no more
high buildings for 1110 fire to seed on.

§2 necdum: the text here is corrected from Med.‘ necdum
p ’(·--post)‘ metus aut rediebat lebis rursum.'

§3. plus infamiae habuit, ‘ caused greater scandal,' because
people thought Tigellinus had caused this second outbreak to
please Nero. ‘Aemiliana’ appears to be the name of a poor
quarter of Rome.

ξ 4. tres solo tenus deiectae: these were probably the districts
including the Palatine‚ the Circus, and the Subura. lt seems that
m any temples and large buildings escaped, or were capable of
speedy restoration, even in districts where the private houses were
totally destroyed. The Circus itself was used in the following
year, and the‘ aedes Cereris’ near it is spoken os at the same
date, ch. 53, 1 and 4. On the Palatine the temp le of Apo 10,
where the Sibylline books were kept (ch. 44, 1), and the library
seem to have been preserved.

nearest to the Circus, and contained some of the bronze statues
brought from Corinth by Mummius.

ara: situated near the noithern end or ‘carceres 'of the Circus,
and known as ‘Ara Maxima! Probably it was originally
erected to the true Italian Hercules, the spirit presiding over the
hoinestead and property, the god of good saith, ‘ dius fidius‚’ but
came to be attributed to a Greek worship instituted by Evander
to commemorate the slaying of Cacus, the stealer of 1110 oxen of
Geryon. (Verg. Aen. viii 179 and following3 Ovid, Fast. i543 and
following)

Statoris: for the story of Romulus’ vow to Jupiter, if he would

‘’stay the flig ht of the Romans from the Sabines‚ see Livy 1 12, 6.
The temple was on the Palatine‚ close to the‘ summa sacra via.’
