INTRODUCTION

would be expected, both of subjective motives, as caritate suorum,
xv 38, 73 spe, xvi 24, 2; pugnam imperitia poscebant, xiii 36, 3
(note also facinorum recordatione, xv 36, 33 inclinatione quadam
hostium, xiii 9, 5) ; and of objective causes, as fervore aspernabatur,
xiii 16, 3; magni nominis miseratione, xiv 58, 3. Both types are
seen in xiv 31, 4, qua contumelia et metu graviorum. Note also
non utilitate publica sed in saevitiam unius, xv 44, 83 publica
fortuna, xiv 11, 23 aequitate deum, xvi 33, 1 3 revolutus ad vitia
seu vitiorum imitatione, xvi 18, 4.

20. A very noticeable extension of this use is its frequent employ-
ment as giving the ground of fame, good or bad, as multarum
rerum experientia cognitos, xiii 6, 4 ; experientia probatos, xiii 29, 3 ;
cognomento . . . non insigne, sed copia negotiatorum . . . celebre,
xiv 33, 13 insignis genere sama lascivia, xiii 19, 2, celeberrimae
luxu famaque, xv 37, 2 ; vita famaque laudatum, xv 50, 4; amicitiae
fide et arte medicinae probatum, xv 64, 3; notum amore uxoris.
xv 53, 5; Chaldaeorum arte famosum, xvi 14, 1; matrimonio
senatoris haud ignota, xvi 20, 1. (So too ex primoribus peritia
legum, xiii 30, 3.)

21 [31]. Ablative absolute: some characteristic uses should be
noticed:

(a) the participle sometimes stands in ablative neuter without
noun or pronoun, multum disceptato, xv 14, 4 ; semel edito, xvi 16, 3.

(b) the neuter ablative of the participle stands as predicate, with
a sentence as subject, as satis comperto Vologesen attineri, xiii 37, 6;
scripto . . . ut . . . ostenderet, xiii 56, 4 ; see also cognito, xiv 34, 2 ;
praedicto, xvi 33, 3. (Such an ablative neuter participle may be
sometimes understood from a participle previously used in another
gender; cf. xiv 33, 2; xv 1, 1.)

(c) ablative absolute is sometimes used though the words might
be brought into more direct construction with the verb of the
sentence, as perfecto demum scelere magnitudo eius intellecta est,
xiv 10, 1 3 cunctantibus (sc. coniuratis) . . . Epicharis . . . arguere
coniuratos, xv 51, 1; hausto veneno, tarditatem eius perosus,
xvi 14, 6.

(d) the ablative is thus used by itself without demonstrative or
relative pronoun when the subject can easily be supplied from the
sense ; as vulgantibus, xiii 7, 1 ; promittentibus, xiii 15, 8,

xiv
