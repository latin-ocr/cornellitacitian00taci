a private affair, effected either (1)‘ inter amicos, ’by a declaration
before five witnesses, or (2)‘ per epistolam,¹ bylaletter countersigned
by five persons, or (3)‘ convivio‚’ by reception of the slave as a
guest at his master's table. These forms were often followed by
the‘ iusta manumissio’ ; cf. Plin. Epp. 7. 16‚‘ si voles vindicta libe-

paenitentiae, ‘ change of mind' : not that partial manumission
was revocable‚ but it remained in the power of the patronus to
refuse the further concession (novum beneficium) of the ‘iusta
manumissio!

velut vinclo, &c.: those who had received ‘iusta manumissio'
became Roman citizens; those otherwise manumitted were by an

ξ 2. conprobavere, ‘approved the order of the praetor! The
tribune was acting within the old lines of his official right, so that
the power here assumed by the senate to annul his interference

ius praetorum, ἃς. : this does not mean that the tribunes lost
their right of‘ interpellatio' against a magistrate’ s decree, but they
were forbidden to intervene in a case coming on before other
magistrates by transferring its cognizance to themselves.

vocare, &c.‚‘ to summon from Italy (to Rome) persons liable
