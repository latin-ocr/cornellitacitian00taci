TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 3. maris rubri: the Persian Gulf (Ἐρυθρὴ θάλασσα, Hdt. i 180),
so in ii 61. The envoys returned from Syria along the west
bank of the Euphrates to the sea, and* so back to Hyrcania by
a route beyond the eastern limit of the Parthian power.

CH. 26, ᾗ 1. per Medos: cf. xiii 41, 2. Verulanus is men-
tioned again xv 3, 1.

citis, ‘ proceeding by forced marches.' amittere, ‘to give
up.'

subegit: with infinitive. Cf. Intr. ΙΙ 31.

possessionem usurpabat, ⁴ was seizing possession of.'

Tigranes: presumably grandson of Alexander the son of Herod
the Great. Archelaus was established king of Cappadocia by
Antony, 36 B. C. He was descended from the general of Mithridates
who bore the same name, and who apparently gave his daughter in
marriage to Alexander the grandfather of the Tigranes here men-
tioned.

nepos, ‘descendant,’ he was great-grandson of Archelaus.

usque, Sec„ ‘humbled to the submissiveness of a slave!

ξ 2. durante, &cz Tiridates was preferred, as being a nearer
representative of the house of the Arsacids, with which Tigranes
was nevertheless himself connected.

ξ 3. quo facilius, διε. : the kings next mentioned would have an
interest in protecting the Armenian frontiers‚ by having districts of
Armenia attached to their kingdoms.

pars Armeniae, Sec. ε the text is reconstructed from Med. ‘ pars
Armenia eunt cuique finitima pars nipulique.' Pharasmanes was
king of Iberia, cf. xiii 37, 33 Polemo was king of Pontus with part
of Cilicia. For Aristobulus and Antiochus see xiii 7.

ξ 4. morte, &c.: Anteius had been appointed successor to Uin-
midius five years before, but had been detained in Rome; cf. xiii
22, 2. sibi permissam=‘ left to itself.’

CH. 27, ξ 1. Laodicea: an important commercial city on the
borders of Phrygia and Caria, on the Lycus, a tributary of the
Maeander.

ξ 2. Puteoli: a colony of 300 Roman citizens had been settled
there in 194 B. C., and the place appears from an inscription to have
been again colonized by Augustus. Tacitus’ words here probably
mean that the ⁸ vetus oppidum,’ the old community‚ existing, with
municipal status only, side by side with the colony, was now raised
to colonial rank. The distinction between ‘colonia ' and ‘ muni-
cipium ' had however by now ceased to have any real importance.

cognomentum: the town added to its name ‘colonia Claudia
Augusta Neronensis,’ which was afterwards altered to ‘colonia
Flavia Augusta.'

ξ 3. adscripti: the word is used of the enrolment of additional
settlers to an already existing colony. Tarentum had become a
colony in 122 B. C. ; Antium was originally a Latin colony and was
resettled in 338 Β. C. Nero regarded this town with special favour
as being his birthplace3 cf. xv 23.
