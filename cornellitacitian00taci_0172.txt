Afranius Burrus was promoted to the sole command of the
praetorian cohorts, which previously had been under two corn-
manders, at Agrippina's recommendation‚ in 51 A. D.‚ and he held
this appointment till his death (xiv 51. 1). Of his previous
service nothing is known (the loss or mutilation osa hand is re-
ferred to xiii 14, 5); but he must have been of equestrian rank,
and is called ‘egregiae militaris famae' in xii 42, 2.

L. Annaeus Seneca was born 4 A. D. at Corduba in Spain,
whence his father M. Seneca the rhetorician niigrated to Rome
and rose to the rank of knight. The young Seneca had attained
the quaestorship, and become the leading senatorial pleader by
the time of Gaius; in the first year of Claudius’ reign he was
relegated to Corsica owing to Messalina’s dislike3 in 49 A. D. he
was recalled through Agrippina's influence, made praetor, and
instructor of Ner03 and, with Burrus, was the young emperor’s
chief adviser and confidant. On Burrus' death, Seneca retired
(xiv 52-56)‚ and was subsequently forced to commit suicide for
alleged participation in Piso’s conspiracy (xv 60-65).

His chief works were ethical treatises‚ such as the De Ira and
De Beneficiis3 physica] speculations‚ Quaestiones Natzcrale53
‘epistles ' on ethical subjects‚ addressed to Lucilius; nine tragedies
on subjects taken from the Greek; and a satire on the deification
of Claudius, the ‘apocolocyntosis‚’ relating how the deceased
emperor was refused admittance to Olympus, and condemned to
be not a god but a punipkin (κ ολοκυιτη), or, according to another
version, to play for ever with a bottomless dice· box.
