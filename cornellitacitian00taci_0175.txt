ne quis ad eausam, διας advocates were forbidden to take sees
by the lex Cim-ia, carried by the tribune M. Cincius Alimentus, in
B.C. 204. The law fell into disuse, but Augustus revived it, B.c. 17,
making the penalty for violating it a fine of four times the amount
taken. ln A.D. 47, Claudius limited the see legally permissible to
10,000 sesterces, about ,ζ83ε disobedience involved the penalties of
extortion (‘repetundae ⁷), Anu. xi 7, 8. Pliny, writing under Trajan,
mentions that it was customary sor the parties in a lawsuit to swear
that they had entered into no undertaking to pay their advocates
but after the trial they might make a present to the extent of 10,000
sesterces l‘pecuniam dumtaxat decem milium,’ Ep. v 9, 4); how-
ever, what he says makes it evident that the restriction was usually
evaded, and that the enforcement of the legal limit on the occasion
he mentions was so unexpected as to cause surprise and consterna-
tion. (Evasion was possible through the fiction that the fee was
a free gift. Cf. ch. 42, 5.)

CH. 6, ξ 1. Armeniam: this kingdom was in possession of
Tiridates, brother of the Parthian king Vologeses. Rhadamistus
