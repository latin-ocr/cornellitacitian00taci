SYNTAX

(e) there is frequently an omission of ther antecedent pronoun,
where a relative clause follows participle or adjective ; adulantibus
qui . . ., xiv 47, 1; sociis . quos, xiv 40, 4; apertis quae,
xv 27, 1, ἃς. 1

22. It should be remembered that the ablative has the wide
general function of expressing the circumstances attendant on an
action. This explains

(a) the frequent occurrence of a substantive and adjective in
ablative not definitely refer-able to the categories ‘absolute‚’
‘causal,’ δια, which are names sor special developments of the
general function. Resides ordinary ‘absolute’ ablatives like acri
etiam tum libertate, xiii 50, 3; incolumi Agrippina, xiv 1, 13
mediis decimanorum delectis, xiii 40, 3 ; there are many for which
‘ablative of attendant circumstance’ would be a better name, as
crebra vulgi fama, xiii 1, 2; magnis patrum laudibus, xiii 11, 1 ;
difficili effugio, xiv 37, 33 nulla palam causa, xiv 32, 13 see also
xv 29, 4. Sometimes there is an approach to the ‘ causal' use, as
errore longo⁷ xiii 56, 6 3 talibus literiS‚ xv 25, 1 ; tali iam Britannici
exitio, xiv 3, 3. In xv 54, 1 multo sermone, and xvi 31, 1 longo
fletu et silentio, the ablatives have the sorm of ablative of ‘ descrip-
tion‚’ but are co-ordinated with a past participle and accompanied
with adverbs of time, showing that they are meant to indicate
action, as though equivalent to past participles, i.e.=ablative
absolute. This makes the strange ablative of description dux
diversis artibus, xiv 23, 3, more intelligible.

(b) the ablative of gerund or gerundive as equivalent to a present
participle or temporal clause introduced by dum3 as trahens,
callidumque et simulatorem interpretando, xiii 47, 1; exercendo,
xiv 20, 5 ; in edita assurgens et rursus inferiora populando, xv 38, 4 ;
exturbabant . . . appellando, xiv 31, 55 explenda simulatione
(causal, cf.§ 19), xiv 4, 8; percursando, xv 8, 33 protegendo, xv 57, 3;
alendo, xvi 30, 1.

D . Genitive.

23 [32]. Partitive or quasi-partitive. Such are abundant, the
partitive meaning being often lost sight of, and the construction
being equivalent, as in poetry (e. g. ‘strata viarum,' Lucr. Verg.)‚
to a simple substantive and adjective.
