INTRODUCTION

impartially‚ and was a diligent student and compiler of materials,
aiming at basing his narrative on a ‘consensus auctorum.’ But
like other ancient liistorians he probably had little sense of the
necessity of correetly estimating the intrinsic nierits of the authors
from whom he drew his material. And in the earlier part of the
Annals it is inore than probable that his poi-trait of Tiberius is
unfairly coloured, because he has drawn sor his facts upon au-
thorities violently prejudiced against that monarch. 'For such
suspicions against the subject-matter of the four last books there is
less foundation. The events there recorded took place in Tacitus’
own childhood: as a young man he must have had frequent
opportunity of meeting and talking with people who had lived
under Nero, and in the light of what he heard from them he
would be less likely to be misled by the writers whom he con-
suited, if they were guilty of niisrepresentation. And these
writers were certainly in a position to know the facts.

T acz‘lus’ conception of tlzeszmclion (gf history.

ξ 5. Tacitus’ professed purpose in writing history is a moral
one, ‘to rescue virtue srorn oblivion, and that base words and
deeds should have the sear of posthumous infamy' (iii 65, 1); he
wishes, in fact, to influence rnen in the right direction by holding
up examples of noble conduct for imitation, of base conduct for
avoidance. At the same time it is his aim to point out the right
political conduct sor the subjects of the principate; ‘how even
under bad princes there can be good citizens' (Agr. 42, 5); that
the best course is at the same time the safest, and is one of digni-
fied moderation, such as that followed by Manius Lepidus under
Tiberius, Memmius Regulus under Nero, and Agricola under
Domitian, avoiding on the one hand the vile obsequiousness of
the flatterers and tools, who aster all were discarded by their master
or punished by his successor, and on the other such truculent and
ostentatious opposition as that of Helvidius Priscus, inviting and
incurring destruction.

This point of view gives his work a wider range than that of
a mere biographer like Suetonius. To Tacitus the general working
os the Roman system is interesting as a field for the display of
character, and events are selected and represented in illustration
