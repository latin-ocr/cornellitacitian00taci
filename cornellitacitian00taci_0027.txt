STYLE

one defines the other like an adjective or genitive, is used by
Tacitus more frequently than by earlier prose authors: testamenta
et orbos, xiii 42, 7 (cf. opibus et orbitate, xiii 19, 2) ; ingenium atque
audacia, xv 42, 1 ; Stoicorum adrogantia sectaque, xiv 57, 5 ; cubi-
culum ac sinum, xiii 13, 2.

55 [77]. Anastrophe (cz) of prepositions is frequent in the case of
ab, ad, apud, ex, in and inter, but not found with circa, praeter,
prope, sine, supra, and pro: note also abusque, xiii 47, 2; coram,
xv 24, 3; extra, xiii 47,2; super, xvi 35, 2: following a genitive,
cubiculum Caesaris iuxta, xiii 15, 8 ; so propter, xiv 9, 3: between
two substantives in apposition‚ Ferentino in oppido, xv 53, 3.

(b) of conjunctions; si occurring fifth word, xiv 3, 33 quasi
seventh, xiv 52, 1; see also quamquam, xiv 21, 7 ; ut, xv 14, 1;
donec, xiii 33, 1.

56. Anapliora: qui, xiii 21‚7; quantum, xiii 28, 43 noti, xiii 35, 3;
sine, xiii 35, 3 ; ἃς.

57. The following expressions may also be noticed here :—

(a) instead of using a concrete substantive qualined by adjective
or partic„ Tacitus osten employs an abstract substantive coupled
with a concrete in the ‘defining' genitive: obiectus molium, for
moles obiectas, xiv 8, 2 ; contrario sagittarum iactu, xv 9, 1
(=sagittis ex adverso iactis) ; communione parietum, xv 43, 4.

(b) an adjective is sometimes used in agreement with a substan-
tive to which it does not appear properly to belong, (⁴ Hypallage ’):
novus nuntius contumeliae, xv 1, 2 ; diros sacrorum ritus, xvi 8, 2.
The idiom is common in Greek tragedy (e. g. νεῖκος ἀνδρῶν ξύναιμον,
Soph. Ant. 793), and arises from regarding the substantive with its¹
qualisying genitive as a single notion.

111. INFLL'ENCE OF THE STUDY OF BREvffv.

58 [80]. Ellipses. Many such have been already noted, as the
omission of verbs, ς 27, of prepositions‚ ἐξ 5, 8, 13, 14, 19, and other
particles, ξ 48, as well as many usages adopted for conciseness os
expression.

Note also the passage nec amplius quam ἃς, xiii 40, 6 ; qui . . .
cremabantur, xvi 13, 2 ς aspexeritne &c.‚ xiv 9, 1.

59 [82]. Parentbetical remarks are sometimes expressed concisely
bv one or more words apparently in apposition in the nominative
