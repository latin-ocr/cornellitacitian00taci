TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 5. artem, δια, ‘was proficient in the art of weighing out his
words' (so as to say nothing that could compromise him), ‘being
besides (turn) full of vigour in the matter of his speech, or, if
obscure, designedly so! Tacitus‘ criticism in Ann. i 11, is hardly
consistent with this: there he says, ‘Tiberioque etiam in rebus
quas non occuleret, seu natura sive adsuetudine, suspensa (⁶ hesi-
tating ') semper et obscura verba.’

§ 6. turbata mens, ‘ disordered intellect.’

quotiens: with subjunctive of repetition. See Intr. ΙΙ 41.

meditata, ‘ a prepared speech.’

requireres, ‘would you miss literary skill.' Suet. criticizes
a work of his as composed ‘magis inepte quam ineleganter.’

ξ 7. vividum animum, ‘vivacious intelligence.'

caelare, &c., substantival infinitives, in appos. to ‘ alia.’

aliquando, ‘at times? Later on poetica] composition became
his ruling passion: Amz. xiv 16, 1.

CH. 4, ξ 1. patrum, his salutation as ‘imperator' by the
soldiers had preceded the recognition of his succession by the
senate; here, however, in addressing the ‘patre5,’ he pays them
the compliment of mentioning them first.

consilia, ‘spoke of the advice and example he had for excellent
government! ‘ Consilia‚' that of Seneca and Burrus: exempla,
that of Augustus.

wars’ (like that of Augustus) ‘nor in family enmities ' (as was the
case with Tiberius, Gaius. and Claudius).

adferre, ‘ was bringing to the throne)

ξφ.. formam, ‘sketched out the lines which his rule should
follow.’ He proposed to follow Augustus’ policy. Cf. Suet. ‘ex
Augusti praescripto imperaturum se professus)

invidia: nominative.

non enim, &c. : referring to the private trials so prevalent under
Claudius, which appear to have taken cognisance of all kinds
of charges. As to Nero’s promise, see Intr. 111 24 3 and for trials
before Nero’s private court, cf. ch. 23, 4; xiv 62, 63 xv 58, 3 and
note on xv 73, Ι.

venale : such as the tras-fic in the ‘civitas ’ and other privileges,
carried on by Messalina and the freedmen.

be kept strictly separate!

ξ 3. antiqua munia: see Intr. III 8.

consulum: i. e. deputations from the senatorial (here called
‘publicae ²) provinces and from Italy would apply to the consuls in
their judgement-seats in the comitium to be granted a hearing
before the senate. Cf. ch. 48.

mandatis exercitibus, ‘the armies entrusted to him! This
phrase also implies the emperor’s supervision of the non-senatorial
prox nuces.
