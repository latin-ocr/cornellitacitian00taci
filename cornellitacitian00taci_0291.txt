BOOK XV. CH. 69. ξ 2 - CH. 73, ἐξ 1-—4

CH. 72, ξ 1. e'x modo annonae, ‘according to the market
price'3 cf. ch. 18, 33 39, 2. The change here described applies
to the praetorians, who hitherto had the price of their rations
stopped out of their pay, which accordingly was higher than
that of the ordinary legionaries (cf. Anni 17), who had received
free corn rations since the time of Augustus.

ξ 2. Turpiliano: cf. xiv 29.

Nervae: subsequently Emperor, in succession to Domitian,
96 A.D. At this time he was about thirty-three years old. He
and Turpilianus probably received these honours as being members
of the Emperor's privy council; cf. ch. 23. 2.

ξ 3. qui quia: Med. reads ‘ nymphidio quaffitss emended in
older editions to ‘ de quo quia nunc.' Probably a larger gap exists,
as Tacitus usually gives two names when mentioning a. person for
the first time. (Ritt. suggests ‘ Nymphidio Sabino. De Nym-
phidio, quando nune,’ ἃς.)

pars . . . erit, ‘will be prominent in the massacres at Rome.'
The expression is suggested from Verg. Aen. ii 6 ‘quorum pars
magna fui,’ and the words indicate that the story of his attempt
to make himself emperor after Nero's death (68 A.D.) and his death
at the hands of the soldiers would be included in the narrative, now
lost, at the end of this book.

ξ 4. principum, ‘of the imperial family!

ex Gaio Caesare: Plutarch discredits this story, ancl says
Nymphidius’ father was Martianus, a gladiator.

habitu: here=personal appearance. According to Suet. Cal. 50,
Gaius was ‘statura eminenti, corpore enormi, . . . oculis et tem-
poribus concavis, fronte lata et torva.’

inlusit: here probably is lost a further description ofNymphidius’
early lise, including his promotion to the post of colleague with
Tigellinus in command of the praetorians, in succession to Faenius
Rufus.

CH. 73, ξ Ι. sed: resuming the narrative aster the digression.

conlata, ὅξος the conspirators had not been tried (as was usual
under Tiberius) in the senate, but privately before the princeps at
his Servilian villa (ch. 58, 3). Hence he published this record of
the proceedings to show that the conspiracy was real.

§a tamquam: Intr. II 50.

ξ 3. adultam, ‘matured.’

revictam, ‘ brought home to its perpetrators,’=‘ convictam!

§4 Gallionem: the proconsul of Achaia mentioned in Acts
xviii 12. He was originally named Annaeus Novatus, but changed
his name on being adopted by the Gallio ofAnn. vi 3, 1. According
to Jerome, he was forced to commit suicide in the year following this.

Clemens: otherwise unknown.

hostem et: parricidam: the same words are used by the
senators against Catiline (Sall. Cat. 31), and by the f‹›1lowers of
Otho against Vitellius, Hz'ss. i 85. The words allege participation
in the conspiracy,
