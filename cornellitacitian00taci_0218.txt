TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 7. ultro, ἃς, ‘took it on himself to make up a stage effect to
support a charges

CH. 8, ξ 1. interim: the narrative is taken up from the end
of ch. 5.

vulgato . . . quasi, ‘made known as the result of an accident.'
See Intr. II 50.

decurrere: historic infinitive. So also ‘scandere‚' &c. in ξ 2.

ξ 2. molium obiectus = ‘obiectas moles’3 Intr. 1157. Cf. ‘strata
viarum’ in Vergil, Aen. i 422. The words denote embankinents
to reclaim land from the sea, like those referred to in Horace,
Od. ii 18, 20.

ut ad. gratandum: this use of ‘ut’ like that of ‘tamquam'
and ‘ quasi ’ (see Intr. 11 50) need not iinply that the intention was
insincere, but merely that such an intention was to be inferred from
the act.

ξ 3. servorum: partitive genit.

exterritis, ‘frightened away‚’ cf. xiii 56, 5.

§4 anxia: abl. abs. In the following clauses, which express
Agrippina's thoughts, supply ‘veniret' after ‘quod,' and ‘esse’
with ‘solitudine1n.'

laetae rei: corrected from Med. ‘laetaeretff

ξ 5. respicit, ‘looks behind her and sees! Cf. Verg. Aen. v 167
‘Cloanthum Ι respicit instantem tergo.’

trierarcho: for this title see note on xv 51, 2.

classiario: Anicetus brought sailors because the land troops
could not be relied on to act against Agrippina.

ae, ἃς. ; the following words are in oratio obliqua.

ξ 6. in mortem, ‘for the death-blow.¹

ventrem feri: ‘vrak ταύτην (Le. τὴν γαστέρα) ὅτι Νέρωνα ἕτεκεν,’
Dio lxi 13, 5.

exclamavit: we must understand that her cry was uttered as
the centurion drew his sword and before she received the blow on
the head from the trierarch.

CH.9‚§ 1. aspexeritne, &c.: instead ofthe infin. which we should
expect after ‘tradiderint‚’ a form ofexpression is used as if ‘ incertum
est ’ followed. Cf. xii 52, 3 ‘morte fortuita an per venenum
extinctus esset, ut quisque credidit, vulgavere.’ Cf. Intr. 11 58.

formam: Dio describes Nero as saying οὐκ ᾔδειν ὅτι οὕτω καλὴν
μητέρα εἶχον]

ξ 2. convivali: a couch taken from the dining-room‚ instead of
a proper ‘lectus funebris.²

congesta aut clausa, ‘raised in a mound or enclosed in stone-
work.' Some sort of ‘ tuinulus,’ however, marked her burial-place
from the first} ch. 10, 5.

ξ 3. mox: a few years later. The ‘levis tumulus’ might be
a small stone structure.

villam Caesaris: Seneca (Ep. 51. ΙΙ) refers to villas on the
heights overlooking Baiae, owned by Marius and Pompeius as well
as Julius Caesar.
