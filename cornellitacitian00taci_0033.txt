HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION

Tacitus is full of its debates and decisionS. As of old, it awards
triumphal honours and other recognition of victories ¹, and sends
its thanks or rewards to allied kings as representative of the state ;
it decrees public funerals2 and other honours to the dead ³³; it
makes regulations to repress disorder⁴‚ and curb extravagance⁵
and immorality‚ and to deal stringently with the abuses of religious
or superstitious practices; while, abroad, all important questions
appertaining to the administration of its own provinces are referred
to it. Resides all this, the senate has supplanted the praetor's
tribunal as the great high court of criminal justice, before which
culprits of rank are almost always arraigned‚ especially on the
constantly recurring charge of ‘ maiestas ⁶.'

§q Those, however, who could look below the surface knew
well that, not the senate, but the emperor through the senate,
governed; and that it acted rather as representative of him than
of the state. Every magistrate was really so sar his nominee that
only such candidates as had his recommendation, or at least his
approval⁷‚ could be chosen; and as the entry to the senate itself
was through magistracy³ or bythe direct nomination ofthe princepsss,
every senator must have felt that he owed his position to the
einperor; who, besides the powers sormally conferred on him, had
all the advantage arising from the general recognition that, who-
ever was master of the legions, was master of as much else as he
thought fit to claim.

ministration, the chief difference selt by the inhabitants of Rome
must have consisted in the greater maintenance of order. Seven
thousand ‘vigiles ² were distributed over the city ; a more distinctly

⁷ The princeps ‘ commended ’ two out of the twenty quaestors annually
elected, four out of the twelve praetors, and ‘nominated ’ the consuls. The
consulship was rarely held for a full year : the two consuls who gave their
name to the year retired after a few months, and were succceded by
‘ consules suffecti.’ Two months eventually became the ordinary length of
tenure of this office, so that there were twelve consuls per annum.

⁹ Some senators are styled ‘adlecti a principe.'
