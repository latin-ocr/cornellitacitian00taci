‘ sola posteritatis cura,' Η. ii 53, 3.

and public attendance invited by proclamation.

ξ 3. Gallio: xv 73, 4.

parentibus: xiv 53, 5.

praeposteram, lit. ‘wrong side foremost,‘ i. e. ‘peculiar,’‘eccentric.’
The ‘equites illustres ' might hold such important posts as those of
praefectus praetorii, vigilum, annonae, and Egypti, and so might
become superior in influence and wealth to senators.

administrandis: dative of purpose.

ξ 4. rem familiarem : Lucan must have been wealthy‚ from the
allusion to his ⁴ horti marmorei,' Juv. vii 79, and evidently his
property had not been confiscated after his suicide.

quidem,' ‘tamquam . . . scripsisset’ being a parenthetical explana-
tion of the assignable reason for such an insertion, ‘as though he
had so written in complaint of the injustice of liis death.’ (With
the alternative reading, ‘ scripsisse,’ we must translate ‘he is made
to have written in addition,‘ δια, and take ‘codicillis ’ as ablative,
‘in his wius)

ξ 8. composita, ‘to have been invented,’ by Nero’s creatures.
(If ‘scripsisse' is read in ξ 7 the invention would be Melas)

proditam . . .coniurationem : the circumstances are not known.

CH. 18, ξ Ι. Petronius is believed to be the author of the Satirae‚
of which considerable fragments remain, written in the form of the

of Trimalchio‚’ describes an entertainment given by a vulgar
millionaire.
