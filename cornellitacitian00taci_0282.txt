TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ᾧ 2. navarchus: the term properly seems to apply to the captain
of ι ‘liburznim' (—‘bi1e1nis )‚ as contrastcd with ‘trierarchus‚’
though the distinction 15 not always preserved in literature.

to the cause.’

ξ 4. plura: se. ‘dixit.’

neque senatui . . . manere: emended from Med. ‘neque se-
1111111 quid m-mere’ (which others emend to ‘neque sancti quid
manere ⁵.)

ξ 5. eversae rei publicae: perhaps referring to cuitailment of
the senate' 5 prerog 1111 es

accingeretur: cf. xserg. σειν-(ν. 111 46‘ accingar dicere pugnas.’

prutes: cf cli. 5ο, 5.

ξ 7. composita‚‘ confrontedss a metaphor from the arena.

ξὸ. haud falsa, &off suspecting that the story might not be
salse, even though it was not prox ed to be true.⁹

CH. 52, ξ 1. omissis, ἃς, ‘dispensing with a guard and the
cumbrous accessories of his ⁷’rank ; mole, like ὅγκοςι fortunae,
as in xiv 53, 3.

ξ 2. sacra mensae : cf. xiii 17, 3.

qualiscumque, ⁶ however wicked.’

in illa . . . domo : cf. ch. 42, 1. These words as put into Piso's
mouth are probably an invention of Tacitus, as the building of the
new palace could only just have been connnenced, and Nero was at
this time residing in the Serviliam gardens, ch. 55, 1.

§3 in commune, ‘before all,' to the general body of the con-
spirators (in contrast to‘ timore occulto' ); cf. ch. 63,1. The phrase

him who stood outside the conspiracy, and who would pity Nero, '
ἃς. Τ1115 sentence represents Piso' s thought, ‘ dabunt qui. .sunt‚
quique miserabuntur, the latter becoming imperfect subjunctixe on
the principle that nhen a conrpound sentence in future time is
reported 111 indirect construction, only the main verb requires a
future form.

ξ 4. ne, Sec. .‚ ‘lest he might head a rising in favour of a republic’
(an unfaniiliai use of orior ’.)

sui muneris, ‘a matter of his best‹›wal’ ; cf. Hor. 0d.1v 3, 21
