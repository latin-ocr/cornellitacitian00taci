integro adhue, ‘ while the war was still undecided.’

neque tum, &c., ‘and not even then abandoned, out of regard
sor appearances, despite knowledge of the truth.’ This criticism
is unfair, as the Roman authorities were acting in accordance
with Paetus’ despatches, ‘literas quasi confecto bello,' ch. 8, 3, and
would not get the news of his subsequent failure till the following
spring.

ξ 2. dissimulandis, &c.: dative of purpose, ‘to hide his anxiety
about foreign affairs? The imputation of this motive is wholly
gratuitous.

frumentum plebis : stored for sale at a low price. It was part
of the ‘ cura annonae ' to regulate prices by sale from public stores,
and by compensating inercliants for selling below mai-ket value in
times of scarcity(cf. ch. 39, 2). Costs connected with the ‘frumentum
publicum’ were formerly borne by the ‘aerariuin,' especially from
the revenues of the senatorial provinces, but under Claudius or
Nero were tiwansfened to the‘ fiscus' (lnt1. 111 25).

vectigalibus publicis: strictly= the indirect taxes payable to
the‘ aerarium publicum‚’ see xm 50 1; but possibly the term is
here used in a wider sense and includes the tribute of the senatorial
provinces, and in fact the whole rev enue of the‘ aerarium’

priorum: this would best apply to Gaius.

qui, dc„ ‘who by their extravagant expenditure had exceeded
the proper revenue.'

se, δια, ‘whereas he annually made a present of sixty million
sesterces to the state.’ This may refer to the transference of the
‘cura annonae' to the ‘fiscus‚' or perhaps Nero meant more
generally that the state expenditure carne annually to that amount
in excess of his revenues from public sources, and that he made up
the deficit froin his own ‘res privata.'
