INTRODUCTION

their original idea. Not unfrequently the princeps also filled one
of the consulships¹, rather as a recognition os the dignity of the
office than as deriving any additional power from it. Otherwise,
the annual magistracies existed on their ancient footing, and dis-
charged their usual duties of rontine3 the most important being
those of the consuls, as the regular presidents of the senate, and of
the praetor5‚ as presiding over and regulating the ‘ iudicia publica.’
Side by side with thern were important new officers directly ap-
pointed by the princeps; of whom the ‘ praefectus praetorio' and
‘praefectus vigilum’ were his military and police vicegerents in
Rome, while the ⁴ praefectus urbi ’ and ‘ praefectus annonae ’ must
have encroached on some functions of the republican magistrates ².

ξ 7. Passing from the magistrates to the senate and the comitia,
we find that one of the first acts of Tiberius was practically to
annihilate the latter body, by transferring the election of magis-
trates to the senate ³. The people may probably have felt that
the substance of power had long since departed from them, and
that only the shadow had now followed it: at any rate, the
change took place without serious opposstion, and the populace
were lest with nothing henceforth to care for but their bread and
their amusements ⁴.

ξ 8. With the senate it was outwardly far otherwise. In place
of the ‘senatus populusque Romanus,' in whose name the acts of
Rome used to run, this august body alone remained, with ap-
parently still more than its ancient majesty. ‘Affairs that con-
cerned the state, and the most important affairs which concerned
individuals ⁵,’ were still handled by it with apparent freedom; its
decrees come to differ only in form from laws 3 in choosing magis-
trates, who by virtue of such magistracy become senators ⁶, it is
formally a sels-elective body3 in form even the right os choosing
the princeps himself devolves upon it⁷; the whole narrative of

¹ xiii 11 ; >iiii 31 ; xiii 34.

² An attempt to bring a criminal before a praetor rather than the
praefectus urbi is notieed in xiv 41, 2.

³ xiv 28. ¹ ‘Panem et ei1·censes‚' Juv. 10, 81. ⁵ iv 6, 2.

⁶ As a rule, the senate was entered through the quaestorship.

⁷ Thus after the death of Claudius the senate confirmed the soldiers'
choiee of Nero, xii 69, 3.
