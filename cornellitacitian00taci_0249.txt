sororem: because Nero had been adopted by her father Claudius.
communes Germanicos ε her grandfather Drusus was honoured
at his death with the title Germanicus, to be borne by himself and
his posterity.

ξ 3. pressus: ‘repressus ’ς the simple verb for the compound, as
‘moveo' ch. 59, 6 and ch. 18, 1 (Intr. ll εδ).

vapore, ‘hot air.’ (ί Heat‚' xi 3, 2, and xv 43. 5.)

ξ 4. dona, Sec„ ‘ As for the gifts to the temples decreed on this
occasion, how long must Ι go on recounting (such hypocrisy) ’?
For ‘quem ad finem ¹ cf. Cic. Cal. i 1 ‘quem ad finem sese
effrenata iactabit audacia?' The text thus emended gives a
thoroughly characteristic sentence, combining the special con-
sideration (ί why describe the gifts decreed on this occasion?’)
with the general refiecffion, ‘how many more such acts munt Ι
recount ? ’ A MS. inferior to Med. gives ⁴ dona . . . decreta: quod
cum ad finem memorabimus ut,' &c.; but this would require
‘finem ’ to be taken in the unusual sense ‘purpose‚’ ‘design‚² and
makes the whole passage sar less forcible.

ξ 5. auctoribus: ablative absolute.

praesumptum habeant, ‘let them take sor granted! For
similar use of ‘ habere ⁷ cf. xiii 21, 3.

ξ 6. neque tamen, &c., ‘ however, I shall not pass over in silence
any decree of the Senate showing novel forms os flattery or sinking
to the Lowest depths of obsequiousness.' For ‘postremus' in this
sense cf. ‘servitus postremum malorum omnium ’ Cic. Phil. ii 44.

CH. (35, ξ 1. creditus est: Intr. 11 33. Doryphorum: it ap-
pears from Dio that he held the post ‘a libellis’ (=secretary to
attend to petitions to the Emperor), in which he probably succeeded
Callistus, Amr. xi 29, Ι.

quasi: this need not imply that the cause was a mere pretext3
see Intr. II 50.

Pallantem: cs. xiii 14, 1-2. Dio gives his wealth as 400
million HS.

detineret, ‘was keeping from him! Nero, as Pallas’ former
master, would receive a portion of his wea·th, by the ‘lex Pap³a
Poppaea‚' if there were sewer than three children to inherit it.

ς’ 2. Romanus: a proper name, mentioned without any further
description, perhaps because particulars about him were given in
the part of the Annals now lost.
