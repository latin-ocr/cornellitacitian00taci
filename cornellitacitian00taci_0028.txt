and equivalent to a relative clause ; see rarum, xiii 2, 1 ; incertum,
xiv 7, 2. This is to be distinguished from the use noted in ξ 6, a.

60 [83]. Zeugma is frequent: cf. ostendere, xiii 35, 7; sumpsere,
xiv 17, 2; exercendo, xiv 20, 5 ; accenderant, xv 4, 4; ardesceret,
xvi 29, 1.

61 [84]. Pregnant constructions are adopted for conciseness :
comitia . . . composuit, xiv 28, 1 3 cf. mense5‚ xvi 12, 3; dies con-
temptus, xv 57, 2.

IV. INFLUENCE OF THE STUDv or VARIETY.

62 [85]. To this may be ascribed variations in the form of
Eastern names, as Artaxata, varying between 1st and 3rd declen-
siens, ii 56, 33 xiii 41, 4; so also Tigranocerta, xiv 24, 6; xv
4, 2; xiv 23, 1; xv 6, 2: and Vologeses, varying between 2nd
and 3rd, xiii 37, 1 ; xiii 7, 2. So too Tacitus uses both alioqui and
alioquin3 balneae and balneum3 dein and deinde3 grates and
gratias agere ; inermis and inermus; senecta and senectus, &e-

63 [86]. Names often mentioned are varied; cf. Paetus Thrasea,
xiii 49, 1, but Thrasea Paetus, xiv 12, 2 ; and in many other places
simply Thrasea, as xvi 21, &et or the cognomen alone is used,
when the name has been given more fully above.

64 [87—91]. Changes in the form of the expression are osten
introduced in corresponding clauses, simply sor the sake of variety;
some of the commonest are—

(a) From one preposition to another ofsimilar meaning; adversus
. . . contra, xiii 35, 1 ; in . . . apud, xiv 14, 2.

(b) from a simple case to a case with a preposition ς adversa
pravitati ipsius, prospera ad fortunam referebat, xiv 38, 5.

(c) from asyndeta to conjunctions, or from one conjunction to
another.

(Osten however such changes mark different grades of connexion.)

(d) change of case or of number, pedes equites, xiv 29, 4;
senatores eques miles feminae, xv 48, 1.

(e) change of Voice: prorupisse rursum Parthos et rapi Arme-
niam,xiii 6, 1 ; trepidatur . . . diffugiunt, xiii 16, 4; ef. also xiv 24, 7.

(f) from ablative to participle, pars mora, pars festinans, xv 38, 55
ef. inpunitate . .. occultus, xiii 25, 4; familiaritate adductus‚xiv 4,8;
cupidine. . . metuenti, xv 36, 6 ; revolutus . . . imitatione, xvi 18, 4.
