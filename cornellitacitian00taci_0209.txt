BOOK XIII. CH. 52, ξ 3—CH. 55, §§ 1-5

Caesar to Hyrcanus and his sons. Augustus forbade the introduction
of soreigners into the senate’s seats, but his prohibition had evidently
come to be disregarded. Suetonius relatos the same incident as
having happened in the reign of Claudius (Cl. 25), describing the
ambassadors whom the Germans saw as Parthians and Armenians.

ξ 6. comiter, ‘good naturedly.’

quasi, δία, ‘as (a mark) of primitive impetuosity and (an act of)
praiseworthy rivalry.'

CH. 55, ξ 1. agros: the district referred to lay between the Rhine,
the Lippe‚ and the Ems.

Ampsivarii: the name is connected with ‘Amisia‚’ the ancient
name of the river Ems.

Chaucis: a powerful German tribe whose invasion of Lower Cer-
many was stopped by Corbulo, about 47 Α. D. (Anu. xi 18). Their
proper territory lay on either side of the lower WVeser (Germ. 35).

ξ 2. aderat, iis, ‘came to plead sor them‚' as their advocate.

rebellione Cherusca: the rising against Varus, headed by
Arminius, in 9 A. D.‚ aster which Tiberius was general in Germany
sor two years, and Germanicus from 13 to 16 A. D. The Cherusci
were NE. of the Chatti, and held the country between the Elbe
and the Weser, i. e. portions of Hanover and Brunswick.

quinquaginta: reckoning from Varus' disaster, 9 A. D.

subiceret, ‘kept obedient’ through all that time.

ξ 3. quo . . . iacere, ‘to what purpose was so vast a space left
vacant? ² Cf. ‘ quo mihi fortunam, si non conceditur uti ?' (Hor. Ep.
i 5, 12).

in quam, δια, ‘that the flocks and herds of the soldiers might
occasionally be sent across to it ?’ i. e. why leave so much ground
unoccupied when it was so seldom used? Med. ‘ quotam partem,’
&c.‚ ‘ how small a fraction of the land was that to which the fiocks
were now and then sent ’; i. e. how small a part was ever used sor
its alleged purpose. Taken thus, ‘iacere' may be regarded as a
gloss for ‘ esse ’ understood.

ᾧ 4. servarent sane, &c.: sarcastically; ‘by all means let them
- keep preserves sor their flocks while human beings were starving,
only let them not prefer an uninhabited wilderness to friendly
tribes (in their neighbourhood).’ receptus and famem are cor· ·
rections for ‘receptos’ and ‘famarm’ lf we retain the two latter
words, we may render, ‘let them preserve them, received among
their flocks (i. e. give them a refuge with their cattle), within
range of a human voice‚’ or ‘amid human report ’ (i. e. still known
among men) ; but the latter expression is unnatural.

ξ 5. Chamavorum: mentioned in Germ. 33; in Tacitus' time
they had moved further into the interior from their original position
near the Rhine.

Tubantum: a tribe who had originally lived near the Yssel and
migrated in a south-easterly direction to a position south of the Ruhr.

Usiporum: the Usipi (also written ⁶ Usipetes ⁷) are usually
mentioned in conjunction with the Tencteri (Germ. 32); they
