TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ξ 2. Thrasea: cf. xiii 49, 1.

exempla=‘ deeds worthy of being taken as an exaniple,’ hence,
as here, ‘punishments‚’ ‘honourable measures of exemplary retri-
butionss Cf. Xiv 44, 7.

§3 licentia,‘ wickedness‚’‘ corruption.' For the Cincian law
cf. xiii 42 2.

Iulias: passed by Augustus, 18 and 8 B. C.

Calpurnia: the ‘lex Calpurnia de repetundis,’ passed by the
tribune L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi, in 149 B. C.‚ is remarkable as the
first constitution of a ‘quaestio publica.¹ The variation of ternis
here employed (‘rogationem‚’ ‘leges,' ‘scita ’) is only rhetorical:
the enactments named were probably all in form ‘plebiscita.'

nam, &c., ‘sor the sin precedes its penalty, correction is subse-
quent to wrong-doing! A similar sentiment is attributed to Cato
in Livy xxxiv 4, 8.

ξ 4. fide, ‘honour’ (in dealing with provincials).

constantia, ‘dignity,’ ‘sels-respect,' the feeling that should keep
Romans from courting the praise os their inseriors.

nobis, &c., ‘while we may be relieved of any idea that the
estiination os a man’s character depends on anything else than the
verdict of his fellow-citizens.’

CH. 21, ξ 1. privati, &c.: referring to the senatorial privilege
of travelling on a ‘libera legatio.’

quid, ἃς. ‘to report what was their iinpression of the loyalty of
various provincials, and the subject-peoples were anxious as to the
opinion of individual Romans!

ξ 3. ostentandi: as the text stands, the idea of‘custom‚’ ‘habit ⁸
must be supplied with this gerund, in the same way that a sub-
stantive is supplied with the gerundial genitives in xiii 26, 4
and xv 5, 3, though in these latter cases a neuter adjective in the
clause suggests the requisite word. A good correction proposed is
that of Madvig, wlio suggests that ‘potentiam' is a corruption of
‘ potestas sententiam)

laus falsa: on the part of the subjects. malitia, crudelitas,
‘wrong-doing,' ‘cruelty,’ on the part of the governor.

ξ 4. demeremur, ‘seek to obligel

CH. 22, ξ 1. perfici: cf. xiv 49, 1 and xiii 49, 2.

abnuentibus . . . relatum: sc. ‘ esse.’ ‘ Abnuere’ has the force
of‘negare.' (It is possible also that ‘relatum’ is a substantive,
cf. Intr. I[ 51 a.) The consuls were naturally anxious to consult
the princeps on this question, as it affected his ‘leuati’ as well as
sen ltOrl 21 3⁷·0iernors.

ξ 2. sanxere, &cs Augustus had in 11 A. D. forbidden such votes
of thanks to be passed by provincials till sixty drys had elapsed
