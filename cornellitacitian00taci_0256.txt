the Roman troops on the eastern frontier of Cappadocia t‘extrema
Cappadocia') instead of at Tigranocerta. We may presume the

bolies the comments passed at Rome the following spring„

ᾗ 3. meritae, ‘earned,' ‘acquiredf (The word does not neces-
sarily convey the notion of ‘ 1nerit,' cf. ‘ vulnera mereri,' Germ. 14, 53
‘ex eo quod meruerat odio,’ Caes. B. G. vi 5, 2.)

non: cf. xiii 40, 3.

ξ 4. ut rettuli: ch. 3, 2.

aaventare audiebatur: Intr. II 33.

were not occupied by any Roman legions.
