BOOK XV. CH. 43, ξ 1 - CH. 44, ἕξ 1-5

books ordered special sacrifices to them to expiate prodigies, e. g.
Livy xxxvi 37, 4.

apud proximum mare: i.e. at Ostia, where invocation was
made and whence lustral water was brought to wash her ‘cella’
and statue in the Capitol.

sellisternia: these answer in the case of goddesses to the
‘lectisternia ⁹ in honour of gods, the distinction being founded on
the Roman custom, by which women sat on ‘ sellae ⁷ at dinner, while
men reclined on couches. (The word is very rare, ‘ lectisternium’
being commonly used for this mode of honouring goddesses as
well as gods.)

pervigilia: nightly festivals (παννυχίδες) were an ancient custom
in Greece, but a late introduction at Rome, though common under
the Empire.

ξ 2. quin . . . crederetur, ‘ so that it was not believed,' epexegetic
to ‘infamia decedebat! Freely, ‘could the scandal be removed by
securing disbelief that the fire had been commanded.'

ξ 3. subdidit: used of fraudulent substitution, or false sug-
gestion; cf. xiv 40, 2 ‘subdidit testamentum.' This expression,
and the words ‘forte‚ an dolo principis ’ ch. 38, 1, show that
Tacitus did not consider the Christians really guilty of the fire.

quaesitissimiS, &c., ‘punished with a retinement of cruelty.'

per flagitia, ‘ by reason o‘f their abominations.’ So the younger
Pliny, writing from his province to Trajan about the Christians‚
speaks of‘ flagitia cohaerentia nomini? Crimes such as infanticide,
cannibalism, and incest were attributed by the pagan world to the
early Christians.

Christianos: the term is said to have originated at Antioch,
Acts xi 26. The formation is in accordance with silver Latin
usage, cf. ‘Augustiani¹ from ‘Augustus,' xiv 15, 8, but may
equ-ill y well be attributed to the Greek of the Asiatics of that time

ξ 4. Christus: given by Tacitus, and also by Pliny (in the letter
mentioned above) as a proper name, probably the only name of
our Lord known to them, and here of course appropriate as ex-
plaining ‘ Christianos) This passage is the earliest record of the
Crucifixion 1n any non-Christian writer.

Pontium Pilatum: not mentioned elsewhere by any Roman
historian. josephus says he was procurator of Judaea, 27-37 Α. D.,
and was recalled by Vitellius, legatus of Syria.

superstitio : any foreign religion, not Greek, would be so termed.
exitiabilis =‘ pernicious,' because of the ‘ flagitia ’ supposed to be
involved in it z so Christianity is called by the younger Pliny ‘ super-
stitio prava immodica,’ and by Suetonius ‘malefica’

quo, δίᾳ, ‘ into which pour all the horrible and foul rites from
every land and there find a sollowing.’ The reference is to
foreign orgies such as those of Isis.

ξ 5. igitur : returning to the main subject.

qui fatebantur, ‘who admitted (their Christianity)'; not of
course that they had caused the fire.
