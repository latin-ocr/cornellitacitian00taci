CH. 23, ξι. ex proconsulatu, t:sor matters arising out of his
proconsulship.’ Soranus was consul in 52 A.D., and proconsul
61-62 A.D. Rubellius Plautus retired to Asia in 60 A. D. and
was put to death there in 62 A. D. (xiv 59). The mention of
Acratus therefore seems to be either an error, as his mission to
Asia is placed aster the great fire 01 64 A. D. (xv 45, 3), or
else he was originally sent fully two years before that date and
perhaps sent out a second time after it.

portui Ephesiorum aperiendo: it was silting up owing to the
deposits from the Ca) ster.

ut, ἃς, ‘that the atrocity at home might be less noticed through
the general talk turning 011 foreign affairs.’ With ad externa we
may supply the idea of such a participle as ‘ versis ’: so in Ann. xi

os' (as though ‘spectantia ad ⁹) ‘valour and 1·enown.’

regio: i. e. like the normal conduct of an oriental king.

CH. 24, ξ 1. ad excipiendum: Nero met Tiridates at Naples
and escorted him to Rome. Some interval may be understood to
elapse between Capito's denunciations in ch. 22 and the formal
accusation in ξ 3 of this chapter.

Ingre,lssgnus, ἃς, ‘would raise their hands in violence agaimt

him. ’ ‘Manus ictusque' may be regarded as hendiadys. inge-
nse-turi sint is a correction for Medd au‹ usti' (11 lthout sint ².) An
emendation nearer to the MS. is to read‘ ictusque parent. Im·
manitatem Augusti eti 1111 bonos metu sequi’ ; but it is very
unusual to find ‘Augusti’ used of the emperor in ordinary lan-

guage.
