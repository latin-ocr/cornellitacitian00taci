ξ 3. neque recepti z the consuls as presidents of the senate might
refuse to entertain a charge brought before them. The ‘ princeps ’
also could always suppress an accusation by using his tribunician
‘ intercessio!

Carrinas subsequently was sent into Achaia and Asia by Nero
to plunder the temples, together with Acratus a sreedman (Arm.
xv 45).

servo accusante: however willing to give evidence, slaves had
to confirm what they stated, under torture, otherwise it was not
taken as legal evidence.

equester: for ‘eques‚’ see Intr. II 2. The charge brought
against Densus seems to be an attempt to revive the law of
‘maiestas,’ under which so many persons were condemned in
Tiberius' reign. Prosecutions for ‘maiestas laesa' seem to have
ceased under Claudius, but were revived later on in Nero's reign
(Ann. xiv 48, 3).

CH. 11, ξ 1. Claudio Nerone. Nero held this consulship for
two months, and was again consul in 57 Α. D. (ch. 31); in 58 A. D.
(ch. 34), · an’d in 60 Α. D (xiv 20).

L. Antistio: his full name was L. Antistius Vetus. He was
legatus of Upper Germany later on (ch. 53); he fell into Nero's
dissavour as being father- in· -law of Rubellius I³lautus‚ and accord-
ingly committed suicide, 65 A. D. (Ann. xiv 58 and xvi 10-11).

in acta, &cz this ceremony, distinct from that of taking the

‘'sacramentum on the accession of a new ‘princeps,’ was the out-
come of the oath taken by the Republican magistrates to observe
the laws. The oath was taken annually on January Ι, first by the
magistrates and then by all the senators, the formula being ί(56)
nihil contra Caesaris acta (facturos).' ‘Acta Caesaris’ implied all
measures passed under the reigning and preceding emperors.

prohibuit: this was to show that he treated his colleague as
his equal in official life.

levium, διο, ‘that elated by the fame arising even from slight
things, he might go on at once (ί continuaret ') to nobler deeds.’

ξ 2. Plautium : his expulsion was probably the act of the senate,
but the power of pardon belonged in all cases to the ‘ princepS‚’
though Nero doubtless at this time followed Claudius in going
through the form of consulting the senate in such cases.

obstringens, ‘ solemnly promising.'

testificando, ‘ sor the purpose of testifying,’ dat. of purpose. See
Intr. 11 11.

iactandi ingenii, ‘in order to display his talent.’ This genitive
of purpose is like the Greek genitive of the substantival infinitive‚
as in Thuc. i. 4, Μίνως τὸ λῃστικὸν καθ yper. τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλον
ἰέναι σίτῳ. Cf. also‘ Aegyptum proficiscitur cognoscendae antiqui-
