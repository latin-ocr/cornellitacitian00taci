INTRODUCTION

moenibus admovere, xiii 39, 4; balineis inseruntur, xvi 11, 4;
rather than cum, licentiae permixtus, xiii 24, 1; Poppaeae con-
iungitur, xiv 60, 1.

9 [17]. Dativus Commodi: (a) rebus conducere, xiv 61, 6, and
the much bolder non referre dedecori, xv 65, 2, should be noted.

[19]. (b) the dative of a noun, so closely connected with another
that a genitive would be expected, is frequent in poets and also in
Livy, and still more in Tacitus: cf. ministeria magistratibus et
sacerdotibus, xiii 27, 2; flagitiis et sceleribus velamenta, xiii 47, 1 ;
vulneribus ligamenta, xv 54, 4.

10 [18]. The Dative of Agent is used without restriction to the
gerundive or adjectives in -bilis‚ and without any prominence of
the idea of the ‘interest‘ of the agent: as Neroni trahebatur,
xiii 20, 1: cf. xv 35, 1; sibi compertum, xiii 43, 43 Corbuloni
audita, xv 3, 1. To this case rather than ablative should be
referred such phrases as cupita aliis, xiii 13, 53 suspecta maiori-
bus, xiv 44, 4; sapientioribus deliberatum, xiv 44, 1; iter Lucullo
penetratum, xv 27, 1 ; parta maioribus, xv 2, 3. See also ξ 16.

11 [22]. The Dative of Purpose or Work contemplated is very
frequent: the gerund or gerundive in this case may follow an adj.,
as dignam . . . suscipiendo . . . imperio, xiii 14, 3; or stand with
a verb, as equivalent to a final clause, as testificando . . . vulgabat,
xiii 11, 2; subruendo vallo inducit, xiii 39, 4, and many other
instances, e.g. contegendis, xiii 13, 2; supplendis, xiii 7, 1 ; firmando,
xiii 41, 3; visendis, xv 10, 4. The same use of this case is
extended to substantives: dux bello delectus, xiii 9, 63 venditioni
exposita, xiii 25, 13 verberibus manus intenderent, xiii 26, 23 see
also ultioni, xiii 32, 1 ; viae, xiii 40, 23 sermoni, xiv 53, 1 ; colloquio,
xv 28, Ι.

12 [23]. This should be distinguished from ‘ predicative’ datives
showing that which a thing or person serves as or occasions, such
as spectaculo, xiii 9, 43 crimini, xiii 10, 3; muneri, xiv 31, 33
irrisui, xiv 39, 3 ; documento, xv 27, 2; ostentui, xv 29, 73 indutui,
xvi 4, 23 usui, xvi 19, 5.

13 [24]. The Ablative os Place whence is used freely, without
preposition, both of proper names, as Italia pellerentur, xiii 25, 43
