TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

§6. operas, ‘their services in the a1·ena‚’ i.e. as gladiators or
‘ bestiarii)

nisi quod: qualifying the idea that these gifts were merely
inducements,——‘were it not that payment from one who can command
carries the force of compulsion.'

CH. 15, ς’ 1. ne tamen adhue: Nero ceased to confine his
persormances to semi-private entertainments in 64 A.D. (xv 33),
when he exhibited himself as a public singer at Naples.

instituit ludos: the first clipping of a young Roman’s heard
was the occasion of a festival in his family: Nero marked this
event in his own case by the institution of the ‘Juvenalia‚' and
repeated the festival annually in his own private grounds, himself
taking part in the persormances given.

passim nomina data, ‘names were given in from all classes‚’
by persons wishing to compete. The phrase is a metaphor from
soldiers answering to the conscription ε cs. also xv 48, 1.

ξ 2. Graeci . . . histrionis: referring to the persormance of
Greek tragedies modified so as to consist of gesticulation and song
(cf. ‘gestus modosque,’ below). For ‘histrio’ cf. xiii 19, 4.

ξ 3. deformia, &c., ‘studied degrading parts.’

nemus: this was laid out by Augustus round the ‘stagnum’
across the Tiber, where contests of ships were exhibited. Cf. illem.
ΑΗΕ. iv 43 ‘navalis proeli spectaclum populo dedi trans Tiberim
in quo loco nunc nemus est Caesarum!

conventicula, ‘assembly rooms.’

stipes: (1) ‘ doles ’ from the emperor, to be spent then and there,
or (2) ‘payment' coming from the public in the shape of entrance
money. The following clause ‘spent by the good under compul—
sion, and by the vicious from vanity’ seems to favour (2). Gloria,
a reprehensible exultation in having made small gains by their own
degradation t consumerent, frequentative.

ξ 4. inde, δια, ‘to this was due the spread of abomination and
infamy, and nothing brought more corruption to our already
depraved manners than did the filthy herd thus swept together.⁹

nec ulla: the fem. adj. is used rather than ‘quidquam’ under
the anticipation of the final word ‘colluvies'

ξ 6. multa eura, &c.‚ ‘tuning his lyre with intense care, and
singing his prelude with his instructors at hand.'

phonascis is reconstructed from Med. ‘facies,' on the supposition
that this is a corruption of ‘foascisss The correction is supported
by a passage of Suetonius describing Nero as never addressing
soldiers 01· people ‘nisi astante phonasco’ (Ner. 25).

ξ 7. maerens ac laudans, ‘ distressed and yet applauding.' An
adversative meaning is taken by a copulative conjunction when the
words joined are sufficiently opposed in meaning, cf. i 38, 4
‘turbidos et nihil ausos.’ So also xiv 65, 2 ‘magna moles et
inprospera.²

ξ 8. Augustianorum: calledby Dio Αὐγούστειοι, and described
as a σύστημα ἐς πεντακισχιλίους στρατιώτας.
