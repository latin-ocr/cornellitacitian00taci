BOOK XIV. CH. 4, ξ 7— CH. 7, Q· 1-5

causing the accident. The verb is subjunct. as giving Agrippina's
reason.

fortuna eius, ‘ thanks to his good fortune.'

ξ 2. securitate, ‘sreedom from anxiety.'

obsignari, ‘to be sealed up,' indicating some kind of formal
inventory being taken, a measure prepaatOry to executing the
legacies under the will.

id. tantum, δια, ‘in this alone acting without pretence! She
probably knew that Acerronia had left her something, and at once
took measures towards securing her legacy, not losing her love of
money (ί ingenita avaritia‚’ xiii 18, 3) even in this crisis.

CH. 7, s} 1. hactenus, διο, ‘having gone far enough in peril
to have no doubt as to the instigator.’ This use of ‘ne’ in intro-
ducing a result is peculiar‚ but is perhaps explicable as containing,
half ironically, afinal shade of meaning, i.e. that the plot seemed
to have failed thus sor the very purpose of showing up Nero's guilt
(cf. ch. 5, 1). '

ξ 2. vindictae: probably genit. So also ‘irae properum,’ xi
26, 4.

sive . . . sive: the alternatives Nero anticipates are (1) an
immediate rising effected by an appeal to the soldiers and sassors,
(2) an attempt to set the constitutional forces of senate and people
against him. sive . . . sive introduce protases to ‘quod subsidium
(fore).'

obiciendo: dat. of purpose.

nisi quid: understand a verb, ‘might suggest something.’ For
similar disjointed and elliptic language in strong excitement cf.
ch. 8‚§4<1ntr. 1127).

The text given here is corrected from Med. ‘espa-gens quos
statim acciverat incertum an et ante zjgmaros! Other suggestions
are (1) ‘expedz'renn quos statim acciverat,’ ἃς, and (2) ‘quos statim
acciverat incertum an aperiens (‘disclosing his plot ⁵) et ante
ignaros! Notice that the final adjective is in agreement with ‘ quos,'
and is unaffected in case by ‘incertum an,’ which qualifies its
meaning, =‘perhaps'). If (2) be adopted ‘incertum an' only
qualifies ‘ aperiens.’

ξ 3. igitur: because of Nero's terror, which made them hesitate
to dissuade him from the murder as they felt argument would be
in vain with him.

an, &c.‚ ‘or perhaps they really thought that things had come to
such a pass that ’; cf. ‘eo ventum ut‚’ xi 26, 2.

ξ 4. hactenus promptius, ‘ was so far the readier as to look at
Burrus and ask.’

militi: the praetorians in attendance.

ξ 5. toti domui: the military ‘sacramentum ’ bound the soldiers
to the protection of all the members of the imperial family. The
expression here, however, might denote merely personal attachment.

summam sceleris, ‘the chief part in executing the crime.’
Cf. ‘Antonio permissa summa expeditionis‚’ Hsst. i 87, 2.
