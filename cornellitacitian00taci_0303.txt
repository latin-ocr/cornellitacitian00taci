of luxury)

§a solutiora, ‘more free from all restraint'3 cf. ‘solutius‚’
xm 47, 2.

sui neglegentiam, ‘ carelessness,’ ‘disregard of consequences.’

in speeiem, &c.‚ ‘ as displaying a sincere nature ' ; the language
of this section indicates that he took a free tone with Nero, as well
as disregarded all moral restraint. v

ἒ 3. consul: suffectus, in some year unknown.

i 4. revolutus . . . imitatione: for similar co-ordination of

populi Romani clades' (Liv. xxii 7, ι), ‘ spoken of as among few,’
i. e. ‘equalled by few,' ‘ one of the worst.’

elegantiae arbiter, ‘the authority on taste,' not a formal title,
though it describes his position at Court, and may well have been
applied to him as a kind of nick-name, and substituted humorously
by himself for his real cognomen in the title of his book, given in
MSS. as ‘Petronii Arbitri Satirae.’ An alternative supposition in
regard to the latter point is that ‘arbitri ’ was inserted in the MS.
by some grammarian who wished to mark the identity of the satirist
with the courtier described by Tacitus.

adprobavisset: frequentative, cf. Intr. ΙΙ 41.

verene, hexameters or iambics.

§5. quem: Intr. 113 b.

sub nominibus, ‘ giving the names‚' to show Nero that the details
of his vices were not secrets.

ne mox, Sec. : so that it should be impossible to implicate other
persons by documents forged over his signatum, as had been done
in the case of Lucan, ch. 17, 5. Pliny also states that Petronius
broke a valuable cup, ‘trullam murrinam trecentis millibus emptam
fregit,’ to keep it out of Nero's clutches. ⁴
