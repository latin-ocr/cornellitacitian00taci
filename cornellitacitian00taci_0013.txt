as are expected of a modern historian, and brings him into line

almost wholly from the four Books contained in this volume.

By the time of Tacitus, Latin prose composition had already
departed much from the standard os Cicero or Caesar, through
the frequent adoption of words and forms os expression from the

Rome of his day had become Greek.
