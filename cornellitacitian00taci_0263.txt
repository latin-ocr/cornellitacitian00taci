BOOK XV. CH. 17, ξ 4- CH. 20, § 1

of the provisions of the ‘lex Papia Poppaea’ (so called from the
names of the consuls of the year 9 A. D., when it was carried).
The law dealt comprehensively with the whole question of marriages
and wills, and, with the object of encouraging matrimony‚ contained
various regulations to the disadvantage of the unmarried and child-
less; thus, m elections‚ a candidate who had children was to be
preferred to one who irad none, and, in the matter of wills, the
unmarried (‘ caelibes ') could not succeed to property, and married
but childless persons (‘orbi ’)could only receive half of what was
lest them, unless related to the testator within the sixth degree.
(The measure failed in its main object, cf. Ann. iii 25, 2, and even
the ruling authorities set it aside from time to time3 thus, ‘orbi'
in many cases received exemption from disabilities‚ by obtaining
‘ius liberorum' by special favour from the senate and. later, from
the Emperor. The disabilities of ‘orbitas' and ‘caelibatus' were
abolished by Constantine.)

inter patres, ‘among those who were (really) fathers!

sortiti: applied, by zeugma, to ‘ praeturas' in the general sense
of being elected. Election to other magistracies as well as to the
praetorship took place in the senate, but the praetorship is specially
mentioned here as being the most important, as it was the natural
step to the government of a senatorial province-except Asia and
Africa, which went to consulars—while the consulship was filled up
at the will of the princeps (by his ‘ nomination ⁷) rather than by the
free choice of the senate.

ξ 2. magna cum invidia, ‘ with loud reproaches? Cf. ‘ precibus
et invidiae,’ xvi 10, 5.

adeunt: the subject is missing; the complainants however are
evidently real parents who suffered by the fictitious adoptions of
their rivals.

ius naturae, Rc„ ‘the right they gained by nature . . . as
opposed to the fraudulent trick of a short· lived adoption.y

§3 honores: here=‘ marks of respect’ rather than ‘the higher
magistracies!

ξ 4. sine, &c.‚ ‘becoming a father without the cares of paternity‚
and childless without the grief of bereavement, attained what had
long been the aspiratio-n of parents!

ξ 5. in ulla, cve. ., ‘in anything partaking of the nature of a
public office‚' or ‘in any branch of the public service'

hereditatibus: cf. note on ξ 1.

CH. 20, ξ 1. Cretensis: Crete (with Cyrene) was a senatorial pro-
vince, and the senate would try cases too important to be settled
by the proconsul on the spot.

ut solent: in sense=‘ qualibus obnoxii esse solent!

ad iniurias, διο, ‘so uplifted as to oppress their inferiorS.’

penetraverat ‘had gone to the length of insulting the senate'
(in the person of the proconsul).

grates agerentur: this was done by a deputation sent to Rome
on the motion of a ‘concilium sociorum '.(cf ch. 22, 2).
