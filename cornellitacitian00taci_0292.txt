TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

ne, &cs this clause gives the substance of the arguments urged
by the ‘patres.' Cf. xiii 53, 4.

composita, ‘set at rest'3 cf. ‘compositis bellis,’ Anu. iii 56, 8.

CH. 74, ξ 1. apud eircumz‘ in circos The sun would naturally
be worshipped here, as being the great charioteer. Tertullian writes
‘clrcus soli principaliter consecratur, cuius aedes medio spatio et
effigies de fastigio aedis emicat ³ (de spect. 8).

occulta coniurationis: cf. Intr. 11 23.

Cerealium: see ch. 53, 1.

Neronis cognomentum: April is called ‘Neroneus' in xvi
12, 3. .
templum, &c.: the expression is obscure, as the place from
which Scaevinus had taken the dagger was already a temple,. see
ch. 53. Perhaps some words are lost, showing that a new temple
to ‘Salus ’ was to be built in Rome as well as some monument at

Ferentinum.

§2. ipse: Nero. So Vitellius dedicated the sword by which
Otho committed suicide (Suet. Vis. 10).

arma, ‘the rising,' of Vindex. See Appendix to book xvi.

trahebatur, ‘was interp1·eted.’

ξ 3. in commentariis senatus ε see Intr. I 3.

pro sententia, ‘ in giving his opinion.'

Cerialem Anicium: for his death see xvi 17, 8.

templum, &ez it would have been an innovation to found a
shrine at Rome to a living emperor; such shrines, under the early
empire, were allowed in the provinces alone. Divine titles might
be applied by courffiers, but formal deification by the senate was not
solemnized till an emperor’s death: hence Tertullian's ‘maledictum
est, ante apotheosin deum Caesarem nuncupare' (Apol. 34).

ξ 4. venerationem, &ez restored by conjecture from Med. ‘et
veneratio ite merito quorunda ad omia dolum sui exitus uerte-
retur! The use of sui indicates that some sentence has been
lost in which Nero stood as subject and his reason for refusing the
honour was explained.
