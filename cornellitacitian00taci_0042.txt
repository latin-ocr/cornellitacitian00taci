INTRODUCTION

and the way in which his friends were dragged into the same
prosecution on the flimsiest grounds shows that he was held to
be dangerous to the principate, as being the head of a coterie pro-
sessing Stoicism and holding a republican ideal of government, as
antagonistic in fact to Nero as Cato had been to Julius Caesar.
There is perhaps the same motive to repress Stoicism to be found
in the attack on Soranus, Rubellius Plautus’ friend aud sellow 51018,
35 1118 nominal charges against him deal with matters long past,
and are evidently mere pretexts for his destruction (xvi 23).

§ 6. At this point the narrative of the Annals breaks off, and our
knowledge of the last two years of Nero⁷s 11181 15 derived srorn
other sources. To his previous crimes he added the murder of his
sister Antonia and his stepson Rufrius Crispinus; his jealous sear
of the commanders of the legions caused him 10 execute Corbulo,

by the numerous references in the Hz‘slories to informers under
Nero, whose careers seem hardly to have begun when the Annals
break off.

§7. For our knowledge of Nero’s overthrow it is much 10 be
regretted that we have not 311 account from Tacitus, to throw
light on the real 311115 of Vindex 31181 1115 relations with Galba and
Verginius, and to show how it was that the armies of three such
dissimilar provinces as Gaul, Germany, and Spain combined sor

from the execution of other legati, that there was no sasety for
1118111 11118181 1118 existing regime3 as sor the soldiers, such standing
grounds of discontent as had caused the mutiny on the death of
Augustus would have been aggravated at this time by news of the
princeps’ conduct in Greece and elsewhere, and by jealousy at the
gists lavished on the praetorians (xv 72, 1), especially if, as
Suetonius says, their own pay was in arrears.

In Rome itself, the praetorians were naturally disposed to remain
