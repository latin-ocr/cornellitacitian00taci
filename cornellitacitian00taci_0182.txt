the supposition that the first syllable of‘levi' was lost in the last

quaesivisset: the subjunctive is used, as this is part of Nero's
thought.

ξ 2. festis Saturno diebus: the Saturnalia of the previous
December.

lusu sortientium: with the dice. Cf. Hor. Od. i 4, 18, ‘nec

chapter and Ann. iv 72, 2, ‘tributum iis Drusus iusserat modicum.’
The construction with the subjunctive is also found in the Hister-ses
of·Tacitus‚ as well as in Terence, Livy, and Ovid.

Older writers who use this expression always make it depend on
a neuter, as ‘nihil' or ‘quicquam.'

ξ 6. educatoribus: i. e. his παιδαγωγοί. Cf. xiv 3, 5.

temperamentum, ‘dilution.’

ξ 7. dum respiciunt. See Intr. II 37, and notice that the
approach to ‘oratio recta’ heightens the rhetorical effect.

rumorem, ‘ popular outcry.'

ξ 8. promittentibus: abl. abs.

cognitis . . . rapidum, ‘ a poison,rapid in effect, from previously
tested drugs.' According to Suetonius, Nero had it tried on a kid,
. which lived five hours ; then, after further concentration by boiling
down, on a small pig, which died immediately.

wrote there had been no younger sons of‘principes.‘

idem aetatis: sor a similar accus. cf. Arm. v 9, 3, ‘id aetatis
corpora in Gemonias abiecta.’
