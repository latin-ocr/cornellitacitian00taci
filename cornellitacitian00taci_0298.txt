death. (Med. has ‘senatus eius’: for the correction cf. Ann. xi

Barium: on the Adriatic5 ‘Bari moenia piscosi,' Hor. Sat.
i 5, 96·

ξ 3. suadenti abrumpere: cf. Intr. II 31.

remittere: corrected in Med. by a later hand for the first
reading ‘peremittere.' ‘He would not excuse his assassin from his
glorious task ' (ironical). ‘ Se ’ omitted, cf. Intr. Il 3 a.

ξ 4. premi = ‘opprimi‚’ ‘ to be overpowered’ (Intr. ll 28).

ξ 5. a centurione: as though ‘caderet '=‘interficeretur.' For
the mood see Intr. ΙΙ 40.

adversis, ‘ in the front of his body.'

CH. 10, ξ 1. Vetus: governor of Upper Cermany, xiii 53;
father-in-law of Rubellius Plautus, whom he advised to resist the
death-sentence, xiv 58, 3.

Pollitta: corrected as being a known Roman name, srom the
Med. ‘ polutia.’ Her gentile name was Antistia, xiv 22, 5.

him with the murder of Rubellius Plautus.⁷

Asiae pro consule: Vetus was proconsul of Asia for the year

‘ amplexa ² above.)

luctu . . . alimentis : Intr. II 22 a.

ξ 5. egressus obsidens: lit. ‘laying siege to his goings-out,'
waiting for him to come out and then, as we might say, besieging
him with her appeals, ‘Egressus' can denote the action quite as
well as the place of exit, and in this sense best corresponds with
‘ aditu?

collegam: he was colleague with Nero in his first consulship,
35 A.D., xm 11.

inmobilem . . . iuxta ε ‘obdurate alike to entreaty and protest.)
‘Invidia’ is similarly used in xv 19, 2.
