INTRODUCTION

history ¹. The effort at variety of expression, besides being part

of the habitual skill of an orator, is further due to the historian’s

desire to relieve what he feels to be the oppressive monotony of⁴
his subject ², by saying the same thing with the utmost variety of

expression, by often giving the sentence an unexpected turn, by

inventing new words or new senses of words, or reviving such as

had become somewhat obsolete.

Of the various usages noted in the following sections, com—
paratively few are altogether peculiar to Tacitus; but many are
new in prose, and all are so far Tacitean that they are used by
him with more boldness and freedom than by earlier prose
authors.
