39 [51]. The potential subjunctive is frequently employed3 in
the imperfect, as requireres, xiii 3, 63 crederes, xvi 4, 4: in the
perfect, as nec facile memoraverim, xv 49, 1; haud promptum
fuerit, xv 41, 1 ; neque . . . crediderim, xvi 6, Ι.

4ο [53]. The subjunctive is used, denotinga fact, with quamquam,
xiv 36, 1·‚ with quamvis, xv 51, 63 and with donec, even when no
idea of purpose or expectation is implied, xiii 13, 1 ; xiv 8, 3.

41 [52]. The subjunctive ofcases frequently occurring is common
in Tacitus in subordinate clauses: with unde, xiii 45, 3; qua,
xiv 13, 23 ubi, xv 58, 33 so too perhaps quae . . . incusaret,
xiv 1, 1 (though this may also be explained as causal).

Non quantum inimici cuperent demissus, xiii 42, 1‚may be referred
to such limitative uses of subjunctive with relative as the phrase
‘nihil quod sciam'; so also nulla caeli intemperie quae oculis
occurreret, xvi 13, 1.

Notice the use of imperfect subjunctive retaining its past con-
ditional force though following consecutive ut, in xvi 14, 5 ; adeo
ut . . . nemo obsignaret nisi Tigellinus auctor exstitisset (for obsi-
gnaturus fuerit).

V. PARTiClPLES.

Cf. also ξ 21.

42 [54]. The aoristic use ofthe present participle should be noticed
(a) in ablative absolute, initium faciente Cossutiano, xvi 28, 1;> (b) as
equivalent to a relative clause with a past tense, vincentium. xiv 36, 2.

43 [54]. The future participle is used expressing Purpose, op-
pressura, xiii 57, 73 elusurus, xiv 41, 2, &o

44. Α participle takes the place of protasis to a conditional
sentence, as nec . . . defuissent . . . agenti, xiv 55, 4; placabilioreir
fore . . . rebatur nulla sollicitudine turbatum, xiv 59, 1.

45 [55]. Α participial expression is preferred to the use of an
abstract noun followed by a genitive3 captarum pecuniarum crimina,
xiii 52, 1 ; receptae Armeniae decus, xiv 29, 2 ; pudore deprehensi
sceleris, xiv 7, 7 3 evulgatus pudor, xiv 14, 5.
