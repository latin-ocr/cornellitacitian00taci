and also xiii 37, 5 where it is used of negotiation or leg 11
pleading as opposed 10( xis ’).

illum, ἂρ, ‘ the place in which he was. and that time, had been
fixed sor a consultation as to what settlement of Armenia they
should arrange!

cernerent: the verb is used in the sense 01 ‘decernere‚’ an
archaic sense, found in judicial language in Cicero and Livy, and
also, of decision by combat, in old poets3 cf. also Verg. Aen. xii 708
( cernere ferro.'

dignum, ‘ a thing worthy of.' Elsewhere Tacitus prefers ablative
with this adjective, but genitive is found with it in Plautus and Ovid.

similarly in Ann. xii 49, 3 ‘ut’ is the fifth word in its own
clause.

CH. 15, ξ 1. Arsaniae. The Arsanias was probably the Murad,
the principal eastern branch of the Euphrates. It would appear that
the Roman camp was on its northern side, so that the Parthians had
to cross it to take possersion of the camp, but the Romans could
retreat towards Cappadocia without doing so.

imposuit: subject ‘ Paetus!

specie, ‘ under pretence of preparing this route sor his retreat)

aster, the semblance of which was employed hythe Armenians’ z i. e.
the Armenians treated the Romans as 11 they had surrendered in con-
sequence of an overwhelming defeat. Simulacrum is an appro-
piiate word, because the acti( ns of the Armenians gave the.
rppearance 01 defeat on the part 01 the Romans, and it was an

‘empty' sembl mee because no battle had been fought. For

salutatio,’ ch. 16, 5.
