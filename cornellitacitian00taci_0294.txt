Romanus?

iv 48, 2.

emereatus: by bribing the ⁴ ianitores.' Cf. JuV. iii 184.

non, &c.‚ ‘not coined into money, but in rude and antique
lnasses' (the ablative is that of quality). Notice the bold
omission of a participle with in formam3 and sor the expression
cf. ‘in faciem,' xiii 38, 2.

ξ 2. lateres, ‘ingots.’ ‘Columnae’ a grandiloquent word for
upright bars.

occulta: sc. ‘fuisses

augendis: dative of purpose.

ξ 3. ut coniectura, demonstrabat: parentheticul. abdidisse

Dido: accusative.

reges Numidarum : such as Iarbas, Verg. Aen. iv 36.

alias, ‘otherwise' Usually in Tacitus it means ‘ at other times!

CH. 2, ξ 1. fide: used strictly with ‘auctoris,' and more loosely
with ‘negotii '; ‘the credibility of the informant and the intrinsic
likelihood of the matter.⁷

‘praeda parata’ in Ovi-21, Her. viii 52,

ξ 2. delectum remigium, ‘picked oarsmen.’

nec aliud, &c.‚ ‘and throughout those days nothing else was
cliscussed, with credulity on the part of the peop1e‚but with lan-
guage of sar different import on the part of the thoughtfulss For
this use of ‘ diversus ’ cf. ‘ diversa simulatione,’ xiv 10, 43 sor ‘ferre'
cf. xv 46, Ι.

ξ 3. quinquennale ludicrum: instituted in 60 A.D.; xiv
20, 1.

ab oratoribusque: Med. has ‘auaratoribus oratoribusque&
Ritt. reads ⁴ [ab oratoribus] oratoribusque‚' considering the former
words interpolated from a marginal note explaining the dative of
agent.

praecipua: sc. ‘ haec‚’ ‘ this was taken up as a special theme os
eulogy upon the emperor!

ξ 4. confusum, &c.: (1) taking ‘ metallis’ as ablative of place,
‘in mines’; ‘confusum‚‘ ‘mixed with othei· substances,' or (2)
taking ‘metallis' as ablative of instrument, ‘gold commingled
with (other) ores.‘ As the text stands, (1) seems best: but in
favour of (2) is the consideration that ‘aliis’ might easily have
dropped out aster ‘metallis' in copying.
