TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

multitudo ingens: a rhetorical expression which we have no
means of reducing to a numerical estimate.

odio humani generis: this impression was probably produced
on the pagan world by the Christians’ abstinence from social
gatherings and popular amusements, in which of course they could
not participate without taking part in some act of pagan worship.
The ablative may be regarded as following ‘in ’; cf. ‘ in hoc scelere
convictus‚’ Cic.pr‹² Sall. 30, 83.

,ξ 6. tergis, ‘hides’

aut . . . atque: the Med. text is here given as it stands, but is
not satisfactory. Either ‘ interirent ⁵ must be supplied after ‘ adfixi ’
and ‘flammandi,’ or these words are attributes to the subject of
‘urei-entur! For the burning of criminals in the ‘tunica molesta,’
a covering of inflammable materials‚ cf. Juv. i 159 and viii 235.

ᾗ 7. hortos suos : on the Vatican. These included a circus3 cf.
xiv 14, 4.

eulriculo: cf. xiv 14,1.

ξ 8. sontes: guilty of the ‘flagitia’ practised by Christians‚ or
perhaps guilty of incendiarism in the spectatorS, not Tacitus’
opinion.

novissima, &c.‚‘dese1·ving exemplary punishment of the utmost
severity.’ So ‘ exemplum ’z‘ punishment‚’ in Caes. B. G. i 31, 12,
‘ omnia exempla cruciatusque edere ’ (cf. ch. 20, 2).

tamquam, ‘ from the feeling that? Cf. Intr. II 50.

utilitate publica: Intr. II 19.

in saevitiam unius, ‘to gratify a single man's ferocity.'

CH. 45, ξ 1. conferendis pecuniis: dative, ‘for contributions of
money '; i. e. for the new palace and the work described in ch. 43,
ἐξ 2-3-

provinciae, &o : in this enumeration we may regard ‘ provinciae ’
as=the tribute—paying provinces (‘stipendiarii ’); ‘socii populi’=
the ‘civitates foederatae ’ς and ‘quae . . . vocantur’=the ‘civitates
liberae’ and those called ‘liberae et immunes’: or else ‘socii populi'
and ‘liberae civitates’ may be taken as a specific description of
‘provinciae‚’ referring respectively to the unprivileged and privileged
peoples.

eversae, ‘were ruined.'

ξ 2. inque eam, ἂρ, ‘to this plundering even the gods must
submit.'

triumphis . . . votis, ‘ on occasions of triumphs or vows.' The
ablative here is the simple ablative of time; lntr. II 15.

prospere aut in metu, ‘ in success or panic‚’ as though it were
‘rebus prosperis aut in metu!

ξ 3. simulacra: Pausanias says that Nero took 500 statues
from Delphi alone, and specifies others taken by him from Olympia.
Pliny also gives a long list of statues, the finest of which had been
pillaged hy Nero for the Golden House, and were afterwards given
by Vespasian to various temples built by him.

Acrato: mentioned also in xvi 23, 1.
