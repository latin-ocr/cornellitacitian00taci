TACITUS ANNALS: NOTES

Tamesae, &cst for the river(‘ Tamesis' in Caesar), Dio employs
the same form as Tamum, οἰκίαι τε τινες ἐν τῷ Τημεσᾳ ποταμῷ υφ-
υδροι ἑωρῶιτο; his account of the appearance (whatever it was)
indicates something different from the explanation one might put
on Tacitus‘ words, vix. an appearance of Camulodunum at the
mouth of the Thames due to reflexion under peculiar atmospheric
conditions.

iam: cf. xiii 43, 3.

dilabente, ‘ebbing.'

corporum effigies, ‘the appearance of human bodie5,' sand-
heaps taking what was fancied to be the form of corpses.

ᾗ 3. iustis, ‘proper‚' ‘regulars

ᾖ 4. tutela templi: this implies that the temple precinct was
an enclosure of some strength.

neque motis, &c.: the negation applies both to ‘motis’ and
⁸ restitit' ; ⁴ nor were the aged and the women removed, the men of
fighting age alone remaining to defend it.’ ‘Motis' = ‘remotis‚'
cf. ch. 60, 5.

ξ 6, Petilius Cerialis was a distinguished general, prominent
under Vespasian3 later on legatus of Britain (Agr. 8, 2), and also
held appointment in Germany.

nonae: this legion, it is thought, was stationed at this time at
Lindum (Lincoln).

quod. peditum: sc. ‘ei erat.' Cf. xv 26, 2 ‘quodque alarum
cohortiu1nque.’

in castra: probably back to the station from which they had
marched (not to Camulodunum, where the temple had been
stormed).

§7. avaritia eius: Dio states that he demanded a restoration
of the money which Claudius had given to the chief men. Tacitus
ignores the story of the exactions of Seneca, see xiii 42, 7.

CH. 33, ξ 1. Londinium: here mentioned for the first time in
Classical literature.

cognomento, ἃς, ‘not (yet) distinguished by the title of colony,
but crowded with numbers of merchants and abundance of
merchandize)

ξ 2. circumspecta, &eq ‘having considered the small numbers
of his troops, and the sict that ’Petilius' rashness had been checked
by warnings sufficiently sev·’e1e ; the infinitixedepends on‘ ciicum-
specto’ supplied fiom circumspecta? Cf. Intr. ll 21b.

§3. quin, ἃς, ‘could not be (lissuaded from giving the order
to start, taking those ubo uould follow as part of his column)
He would not stay to defend the place, but would escort fugitives
to a place of safety.

§ 4. Verulamio. the remains of Verulamium closely adjoin
St. Albans. It was piobably the same as the‘ oppidum Cassive-
lanni ’ in Caes. B. (i 7· x 21.

intutum: here like a passive pa1tiC.‘ungua1·’ded rather than as
adj. ‘ insecure.’
