HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION TO ,THESE BOOKS

ξ l. In the constitution solemnly inaugurated by his acceptance
of the title of ‘Augustus' at the beginning of B. C. 27, Octavian
was content to be designated not as ‘king' or ‘dietatem’ but only
as ‘prince.’ lf this term is, as has been commonly supposed,
shortened from ‘princeps senatus,’ it implied only that (as was
no doubt the fact) liis name stood first on the roll of senators, and
would convey no idea of his relation to the state. The fact,
however, that he is always spoken of not as ‘princeps senatus ’ but
as simply ⁴ princeps ' seems, together with many other considera-

proconsulare,’ whereby, in contrast to those holding a more
limited ‘ imperiu1n,’ he was distinctively the sole ‘imperator ¹,’ or
‘emperor‚' of the Roman empire, and commander-in-chief of all
its fleets and armies. Not only the ‘legati' of his own special
provinces, but also the proconsuls of those left to the senate,
ranked as his subordinates3 and all miiitary operations were held
by a fiction to be conducted under his ‘auspicia²'; while, by
a further extension, this power was valid also in Italy and even

within the walls of Rome, giving him not only the supreme
command of the home army and police, but also power of lise and
death over all citizens, even of senatorial rank, and a special juris-

¹ The use of this title, as commemorative of victories (see on xiii 41,
5'), is distinct from its use to denote supreme command.
