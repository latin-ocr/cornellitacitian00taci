INTRODUCTION

VI. PREPOSlTlONS.

Cf. also for their omission ἓξ 5, 8, 13, 14, 19; anastrophe, ξ 55.

46 [56—63} The following are some of the most characteristic
usages in Tacitus :—

Apud is much used with names of places and countries as well as
with common names, in place of locutive or in with ablative3 as
apud urbem, xiv 26, 13 apud Aegeas, xiii 8, 43 see also xiii 8, 1 ;
xiv 14, 23 xvi 15, 1.

Circa=‘conce1·ning’ (a meaning originating with Seneca and
Pliny mai), xvi 8, 3.

111 (a) with accusative, much used in expressing the effect in-
tended or resulting, like ἐπί or πρός, as in deterius, xiii 14, 13 in
maius, xiii 8, 1 ; 111 1110111115, xiv 39, 4: in subsidium, xiii 18, 3.

(b) with ablative of a neuter adjective, as alternative to em-
ploying the adjective attributively, as in integro, xv 2, 43 in
obscuro, xv 16, 3; in incerto, xv 36, 7.

quta is used metaphorically as an adverb in the sense of
‘pariter,' xiii 32, Ι.

Per has frequently the force of a simple ablative, or ablative with
ex or in: as per noctem=noctu, xiii 38, 63 crebris crimina-
tionibus, aliquando per facetias, xiv 1, 1 ; cf. xvi 18, 1.

Super is used equivalent to de, xiv 43, 1 ; xv 5, 5, Sec.

The following are rare, and in no earlier prose :—

Abusque (Verg.), xiii 47, 23 xv 37, 5.

Adusque (Verg., Horace, Ovid), xiv 58, 4.

VII. ADVERBS AND CONJUNCTIONS.

47 [64]. Comparative sentences are often abbreviated—-

(a) by supplying ‘ magis ' or ‘potius ’ before ‘quam' (as in Greek
μᾶλλον before ἤ) ; libens quam coactus acciret dominam, xiv 61, 63

(b) by the use of 3 positive with ‘quanto,’ without the addition
of magis ; quanto inopina tanto maiora i 68, 5.

(c) by omission of tanto in apodosis3 i 74, 73 xiii 13, 1.

(d) Note also such ‘compendious ’ expressions of compnrison as
clara et antiquis victoriis par . . . laus parta, xiv 37, 5 ; artibus tuis
pares xiv 55, 6.

48 [65]. The omission of conjunctions (asyndeton) is frequent,
owing to Tacitus’ rhetorical tendencies; in lively narration‚ xiv 61, 1;
