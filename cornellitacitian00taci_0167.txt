APPENDIX TO BOOK XVI

SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS BETWEEN
THE END OF BOOK XVI AND THE DEATH OF NERO.

A. D. 66. Tiridates arrived in Rome and did homage to Nero
for his kingdom, obtaining leave to rebuild Artaxata on his return.

In Judaea, the oppressive government of the procurator Gessius
Florus provoked rebellion. The Upper City and the castle Antonia
in Jerusalem were taken by the insurgents, and the Roman garrison
massacred. Cestius Gallus, legatus of Syria, made an unsuccess-
sul attempt to recover the city, and on his retreat was defeated
with the loss of 6‚000 men. The rebellion then spread over the
whole of Judaea, Galilee, Samaria, Peraea, and Idumaea. Ve-
spasian was then appointed as ‘legatus Augusti propraetore’ in
Palestine, with a force of three legions and their complement of
auxiliaries, and Syria with its usual garrison of four legions was
given to C. Licinius Mucianus.

Before the close of the year Nero set out for Greece, leaving the
freedman Helius, assisted by Polycleitus, with absolute power in
Rome and Italy.

A. D. 67. Galilee and the North of Palestine were recovered by
Vespasian, who was assisted by his son Titus.

In Greece, Nero altered the calendar so as to make all the chief
games fall within that year, and competed in various contests in
all of them. He pillaged statues and works of art from cities and
temples, and put many wealthy Greeks to death to get their
property. Corbulo was summoned from the East‚ and then ordered
to despatch himself: the brothers Scribonius Rufus and Scribonius
Proculus, governors of the German provinces, were sent for and
executed without any fair trial ε and similar executions were perpe-
trated by Helius in Italy.

In return for his entertainment there, Nero declared Greece free,
and gave to the Senate the province of Sardinia in compensation.

A. D. 68. Vespasian effected the recovery of Gadara, Peraea,
Idumaea, and Samaria successively, and was preparing sor the
siege of Jerusalem, when the death of Nero was reported, and in
the resulting confusion active operations had to be suspended sor
a year and a half.

Nero returned early this year to Rome, which he entered after
the fashion of a victorious Greek athlete, publicly displaying 1808
crowns of victory! Then, while visiting Naples, he heard that
Julius Vindex, legatus of Gallia Lugdunensis, had taken up arms
against him, supported by the richest and most central tribes of
