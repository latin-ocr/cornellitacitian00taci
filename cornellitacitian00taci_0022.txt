INTRODUCTION

prose-are usually followed by ut or ne with subjunctive, occur m
great numbers in Tacitus followed by infinitive, as orabant cavere,
xiii 13, 4 ; mori adactus est, xiii 25, 23 perpulit suscipere, xiii 54, 3;
abire subegit, xiv 26, 1 3 566 also the infinitives after mandavit,
xv 2, 5 ; monebat, xv 12, 33 placuit, xv 14, 53 scribitur, xv 25, 6;
imperavit, xv 28, 3 ; hortarentur, xv 59, 1 ; suadenti, xvi 9, 3.

32 [44]. The use of the accusative and infinitive is extended so
as to follow accusare, xiv 18, 1, and dubitare negatived, xv 73, 3.

33 [45]. The infinitive depending on a verb in a personal con-
struction is used in some cases where an impersonal construction
would be usual in earlier classical prose, as deferuntur consensisse,
xiii 23, 1 ; haud creditus sufficere, xiii 30, 33 adnotatus . . . praeri-
guisse, xiii 35, 6 3 adventare audiebatur, xv 6, 4.

34 [46]. The historic infinitive is very frequent in lively descrip-
tions‚ as xiii 13, 1 and following; xiii 37, 1, διας and is even used
in temporal clauses when the time at which a state of things began
has already been specified by a finite verb3 thus with curn, xiv 5, 23
donec, xiii 57, 6.

35 [47]. The epexegetic infinhive, a Graecism common in Horace,
is employed, as factus . . . et exercitus . . . velare, xiv 56, 5.

Β. Indicative.

36 [48]. The historic present is very common ε it is so sar treated
as a past tense as to be sometimes joined with a perfect, as in
xv 10, 5; and to have a subjunctive dependent upon it in the
imperfect tense, as ut omitteret maritum emereatur, xiii 44, 1 ; cs.
also xv 9, 2.

37 [49]. Parenthetical or explanatory clauses in the indicative
are inserted in the midst of oratio obliqua, as with dum, xiii 15, 7,
&Q 3 quoties, xiv 64, 5 ; and relative, xv 61, 6.

38 [50]. The indicative is used rhetorically in place ofsubjunctive
in the apodosis of conditional clauses, stating what might have
happened as though it had actually occurred; as exstimula—
verant . . . nisi impunitatis cupido retinuisset, xv 50, 7; or an in-
complete action or tendency, showing vividly what was on the
point of happening, as ibatur in caedes, nisi.. . obviarn issent,
xiii 2, 1 3 or what would have been, in contrast to what did happen,
