don a charge without just cause. The old penalty for ‘ calumnia ’ was
branding with the letter K, apparently imposed by the ‘lex Rem-
mia‚' which is of uncertain date, and referred to in Cicero,pro
Roscio. In later times the penalties were, in civil cases, a fine of
one—tenth to one-fourth or even one—third of the amount involved,
and in criminal cases exile, relegation‚ or loss of rank.
